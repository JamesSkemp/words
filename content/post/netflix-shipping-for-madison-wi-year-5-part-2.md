<h3>The times</h3>
<p><strong>03/26/2011</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Castle: Season 2: Episodes 6 and 7 (2009).<br />
<strong>03/27/2011</strong> (Su) - Finished off the second disc of&nbsp;Castle: Season 2, by watching Episodes 8 through 10 (2009). I'll let it get picked up tomorrow.<br />
<strong>03/29/2011</strong> (T) - MRNOS. Actually, the second one, which is disc 4, since disc 3 is still unavailable. Unfortunate.<br />
<strong>03/30/2011</strong> (W) - Changed to two DVDs at a time plan, for a little under $2 more, so I'm not getting just a 25 minute movie and a movie I've already seen this week. So, next one shipped. Received and watched Black Lagoon: Season 1: Disc 4 (2006), which, again, was unfortunate, since I'd prefer disc 3 first. At least no spoilers. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow. Watched Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent: Season 5 (2005): Episode 5, streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>03/31/2011</strong> (R) - Received and watched Castle: Season 2: Episodes 11 through 13 (2009). Such a good series.<br />
<strong>04/01/2011</strong> (F) - MRNOS. Watched&nbsp;Castle: Season 2: Episodes 14 through 15 (2009). I'll let it get picked up tomorrow, since I missed the mail person by just a dozen minutes today.<br />
<strong>04/02/2011</strong> (Sa) - Received next movie. Watched&nbsp;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent: Season 5 (2005): Episode 6, 7 and 8, streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>04/03/2011</strong> (Su) -&nbsp;Watched&nbsp;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent: Season 5 (2005): Episode 9, streaming on my laptop. Watched Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990), which I'll let get picked up tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. Watched Firefly: The Complete Series (2002): Episodes 4 and 5, streaming on my PS3.<br />
<strong>04/04/2011</strong> (M) - MRNOS.&nbsp;Watched&nbsp;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent: Season 5 (2005): Episode 10, streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>04/05/2011</strong> (T) - MRNOS. Watched&nbsp;Castle: Season 2: Episodes 16 through 18 (2009) on my laptop. Perfect series.<br />
<strong>04/06/2011</strong> (W) - Received next movie, but I don't have time for it yet because ... I&nbsp;watched&nbsp;Castle: Season 2: Episodes 19 through 20 (2009) on my laptop, which finishes off that disc, which I'll let get picked up tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>04/07/2011</strong> (R) - Watched&nbsp;Castle: Season 2 (2009): Disc 5 (all four episodes). Such a sad ending, but ... five stars for the series that's given me so many ups and downs ... Home sick so hopefully it'll get picked up with the other disc later today.&nbsp;Watched&nbsp;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent: Season 5 (2005): Episode 12 and 13, streaming on my laptop (episode 11 had audio issues). (Mail didn't get picked up, so I dropped off on Friday.)<br />
<strong>04/08/2011</strong> (F) -&nbsp;Watched&nbsp;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent: Season 5 (2005): Episode 14, streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>04/09/2011</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS. Times two.&nbsp;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent: Season 5 (2005): Episode 15 was I had seen everything but the very beginning to (before the opening credits), and now I've seen those few minutes. Watched Freeze Frame (2004), streaming on my laptop, which was a great thriller, with a good ending. Five stars.<br />
<strong>04/10/2011</strong> (Su) - Watched Blackadder: Season 1: Episode 1 (1983), streaming on my laptop, which wasn't all that good.<br />
<strong>04/11/2011</strong> (M) - Received next two movies. Watched The Walking Dead: Season 1 (2010): Disc 1: Episodes 1 through 3. I remember why I didn't mind when I stopped reading the series ...<br />
<strong>04/12/2011</strong> (T) - Watched&nbsp;The Walking Dead: Season 1 (2010): Disc 1: Episode 4, and&nbsp;The Walking Dead: Season 1 (2010): Disc 2: Episodes 5 and 6. They've changed things up, which is okay, as it keeps us guessing a bit. But I probably won't watch any more of the series, so 4 stars. I'll drop both off tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer that I received with the first disc.<br />
<strong>04/14/2011</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>04/15/2011</strong> (F) - Recieved next movie.<br />
<strong>04/16/2011</strong> (Sa) - Watched The Limits of Control (2008), which was relaxing, and completely not what was advertised. Instead, you have a sort of thinkers film, paced slowly, leading up to what you assume will occur. Watched some of the bonus feature, but not all. I'll let it get picked up today in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>04/17/2011</strong> (Su) - Watched Notting Hill (1999), which wasn't that horrible, and Firefly: The Complete Series (2002): Episode 6, which is still a good episode (and which features both of the SOCOM 4 trophy titles in it - perfect timing). Watched&nbsp;The Twilight Zone: Season 1 (1959): Episodes 5 and 6. All of the above was streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>04/18/2011</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>04/19/2011</strong> (T) - Received and watched Gothika (2003), which was really good, and kept reminding me of Drag Me to Hell. Although I don't think Halle Berry would have been wearing a bra in prison.&nbsp;4 stars.&nbsp;I'll let it get picked up tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>04/21/2011</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>04/22/2011</strong> (F) - Received next movie.<br />
<strong>04/23/2011</strong> (Sa) - Watched Unknown (2006), which was a rather good movie, with a good number of twists. I'll either drop it off or&nbsp;let it get picked up today, in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. 4 of 5 stars. Watched The Craft (1996) streaming on my laptop, which I had completely watched before. 3 of 5 stars.<br />
<strong>04/24/2011</strong> (Su) - Watched The Crazies (2009) streaming on my laptop, which was an average zombie movie. More of a maniac-type virus, though. 3 of 5 stars.<br />
<strong>04/25/2011</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>04/26/2011</strong> (T) - Received and watched Berserk: Volume 1 (1997): Disc 1, all five episodes. The theme songs remind me strongly of some other anime series, which is escaping me at the moment. The first few episodes are a little confusing, but it does seem to be an anime for non-anime watchers. Moved the other discs to the top of my queue. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow. (Which it wasn't, so I'm going to drop off Thursday.)<br />
<strong>04/27/2011</strong> (W) - Watched Trailer Park Boys: Season 1 (2001): Episodes 1 through 4, streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>04/28/2011</strong> (R) -&nbsp;Watched Trailer Park Boys: Season 1 (2001): Episodes 5 through 6, streaming on my laptop. They'll probably be the last episodes I watch.<br />
<strong>04/29/2011</strong> (F) - MRNOS.&nbsp;Watched&nbsp;The Twilight Zone: Season 1 (1959): Episode 13 and The Stand (1994): Episode 1, streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>04/30/2011</strong> (Sa) - Watched&nbsp;The Stand (1994): Episode 2, streaming on my laptop, even though I said I wasn't going to watch any more. Received and watched Berserk: Volume 1 (1997): Disc 2, all four episodes. I get the impression that he'll soon break from the Griffith's group ... but I still don't understand if it's he that he fights later. I'll drop it off tomorrow or Monday. Watched&nbsp;Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Corpse Vanishes (1989), streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>05/01/2011</strong> (Su) -&nbsp;Watched Trailer Park Boys: Season 2 (2002): Episodes 1 through 3, streaming on my laptop. Watched Gamer (2009) streaming on my laptop, which, other than a few naseau-inducing scenes (camera), was pretty good. I'll give it 3 of 5 stars only because I won't watch it again, but it's otherwise a 4 star movie.<br />
<strong>05/03/2011</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>05/04/2011</strong> (W) - Received and watched all four episodes on Berserk: Volume 1 (1997): Disc 3 on my laptop. Great series. I'll drop it off tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. Upped my plan tonight to 2 at a time (for 83 cents) so I can hopefully get another disc as soon as possible.<br />
<strong>05/05/2011</strong> (R) - Another movie shipped, since I'm at 2 at a time. Changed plan back to 1 at a time, that afternoon.<br />
<strong>05/06/2011</strong> (F) - MRNOS. Received and watched Berserk (1997): Volume 4, episodes 14 through 17, on my laptop. Getting close to the end ... Anyway, I'll probably let it get picked up tomorrow. Watched Gun X Sword (2005): Episode 1, streaming on my laptop, english dubbed. I think the ending theme of this is what I was thinking of regarding Berserk, but it's not the same ...<br />
<strong>05/07/2011</strong> (Sa) - Didn't get my next movie as expected. Watched Thirst (2009) streaming on my laptop. 4 of 5 stars, since it's a solid movie directed by Chan-Wook Park (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Oldbody, Lady Vengeance).<br />
<strong>05/09/2011</strong> (M) - MRNOS. Finally received Berserk (1997): Disc 5, and watched all four episodes on the disc. One more disc remaining ... I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>05/10/2011</strong> (T) - Received and watched Berserk (1997): Disc 6, all four episodes. Really disappointed that it's part of a manga and the show got cancelled before telling the entire tale ... Grr. I'll drop it off tomorrow. 3 stars. Oh, and the anime probably isn't for first-time anime watchers. I'm tempted to say more extreme than Drakengard, due to what happens to Caska.<br />
<strong>05/11/2011</strong> (W) - Per the recommendation of Bill Kummer, watched Trinity and Beyond: The Atomic Bomb Movie () streaming on my laptop. It was unfortunately rather slow, and I think a little short on content, versus explosions/footage. 3 stars.<br />
<strong>05/12/2011</strong> (R) - MRNOS. Watched Trigun: The Complete Series: Episode 1 streaming on my laptop. Maybe it's just the voice acting, but I can't find myself interested in this. Watched Session 9 (2001) streaming on my laptop. A lot of CSI crew at the beginning, but a good enough 'twist,' albeit about what you'd expect. 3 stars since I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again.<br />
<strong>05/13/2011</strong> (F) - Didn't get the movie as expected. Watched The Twilight Zone: Season 1 (1959): Episodes 20, 16, 7, and 34, streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>05/14/2011</strong> (Sa) - Assume I received the next movie; I was out.<br />
<strong>05/15/2011</strong> (Su) - Watched Battle Royale (2001), again. Still as good as I remember it. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow, in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>05/17/2011</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>05/18/2011</strong> (W) - Received next movie.<br />
<strong>05/21/2011</strong> (Sa) - Watched Dancer in the Dark (2000), which was very depressing (hence sitting on it for so many days). I'll let it get picked up today.<br />
<strong>05/22/2011</strong> (Su) - Watched The Masque of the Red Death (1964) streaming on my laptop. 3 of 5 stars, since it's not his best work. Watched The Kids in the Hall: Season 1 (1989): Episodes 1 and 2. Must have watched these on Comedy Central way back in the day, since I think I've seen both. Despite having seen it, watched&nbsp;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent: Season 5 (2005): Episode 16 and Episode 17, which I had also seen, but a much longer time ago.<br />
<strong>05/23/2011</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>05/24/2011</strong> (T) - Received and watched The Getaway (1972), which was pretty dang good. One of the top heist/chase/get away movies I've seen. 4 stars. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>05/26/2011</strong> (R) - MRNOS. Watched&nbsp;Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969): Episode 1 streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>05/27/2011</strong> (F) - Received and watched MASH: Season 1 (1972): Disc 1: Episodes 1 through 5. Removing the other discs from my queue, and I'm up in the air on whether I'll watch any more episodes on the disc. It's a good show, but I could have gotten away with just watching a couple of episodes, instead of entire discs. Decided to just drop it off tomorrow, in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in, but I ended up dropping off Sunday.<br />
<strong>05/31/2011</strong> (T) - MRNOS. Wathced&nbsp;Aaah! Zombies!! (2007) streaming on my laptop, which was actually pretty good. I liked what they did with the color - black and white for the world in which they are monsters, and color when it's just the group trying to stay alive.<br />
<strong>06/01/2011</strong> (W) - Recieved and watched The Mechanic (2011), which was a pretty dang good Jason Statham movie. Not sure about the ending, but it is hard to kill him. I'll drop it off tomorrow in Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>06/03/2011</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>06/04/2011</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Night Gallery: Season 1 (1970): Pilot Episode.<br />
<strong>06/05/2011</strong> (Su) - Watched Night Gallery: Season 1 (1970): Episodes 1 and 2. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>06/07/2011</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>06/08/2011</strong> (W) - Recieved and&nbsp;watched Night Gallery: Season 1 (1970): Episodes 3 through 5, of which I've seen the last one before, with the crazy doll. I'll drop it off tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>06/10/2011</strong> (F) - MRNOS. Watched Cyber Wars (2006) streaming on my laptop. Slow pacing, and a kind of lower budget Johnny Mnemonic.<br />
<strong>06/11/2011</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Night Gallery: Season 1 (1970): Episode 6 and 'Bonus Episodes' 1 through 3. More odd than good were these. 3 of 5 stars for the season. I'll drop it off tomorrow, unless I'm out driving tonight.<br />
<strong>06/12/2011</strong> (Su) - Watched Alice in Wonderland (2010) streaming on my laptop, which was really quite good. 4 of 5 stars. Watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 1 (1997): Episodes 1 and 2 streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>06/14/2011</strong> (T) - MRNOS. Watched&nbsp;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 1 (1997): Episode 3 streaming on my laptop. I like the show, but I'm a bit confused on how Buffy here is 16 years old, while I thought in the movie (which they keep alluding to) she was a Senior (dance/prom/whatever).<br />
<strong>06/15/2011</strong> (W) - Received and watched Gundam Wing (2000): Episodes 1 through 5. I remember bits of the episodes, but don't recall the ending theme at all, nor the beginning theme being quite like it is. I'll drop it off tomorrow.&nbsp;Watched&nbsp;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 1 (1997): Episode 4 streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>06/17/2011</strong> (F) - MRNOS. Watched&nbsp;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 1 (1997): Episodes 5 through 7 streaming on my laptop. Addicted.<br />
<strong>06/18/2011</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched&nbsp;Gundam Wing (2000): Episodes 6 through 10. I'll drop it off tomorrow or Monday morning.&nbsp;Watched&nbsp;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 1 (1997): Episodes 8 through 10 streaming on my laptop. Found an issue where episode 8 or 9 (demon in the network) lists her birth year as 1980, but episode 10 has it as 1981 on her gravestone. Whoops!<br />
<strong>06/19/2011</strong> (Su) -&nbsp;Watched&nbsp;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 1 (1997): Episodes 11 through 12 streaming on my laptop, which completes the season. I'll be watching another.<br />
<strong>06/20/2011</strong> (M) - Watched The Stupids (1996), leant to me by <a rel="external" href="http://conderman.com/">Dan Conderman</a>. Giving it 4 stars since I actually laughed out loud, and could watch it again (at which point I'd probably drop it down to 3 stars).<br />
<strong>06/21/2011</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>06/22/2011</strong> (W) - Received and watched&nbsp;Gundam Wing (2000): Episodes 11 through 15. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>06/24/2011</strong> (F) - MRNOS.&nbsp;Watched&nbsp;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 2 (1997): Episode 1 streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>06/25/2011</strong> (Sa) - Received and&nbsp;watched&nbsp;Gundam Wing (2000): Episodes 16 through 20. I'll drop it off tomorrow<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> or Monday morning</span>. I'm on a roll with Madison mailers ...<br />
<strong>06/26/2011</strong> (Su) -&nbsp;Watched&nbsp;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 2 (1997): Episodes 2 through 3, and then later 4 through 5, streaming on my new Roku.<br />
<strong>06/28/2011</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>06/29/2011</strong> (W) - Received and watched&nbsp;Gundam Wing (2000): Episodes 21 through 25. I'll drop it off tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>07/01/2011</strong> (F) - MRNOS. Watched&nbsp;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 2 (1997): Episode 6, South Park: Season 1 (1997): Episodes 1 and 2, and Married... with Children: Season 1 (1987): Episodes 1 and 2, all streaming on my Roku.<br />
<strong>07/02/2011</strong> (Sa) - Received next movie, but I wasn't around.<br />
<strong>07/03/2011</strong> (Su) - Watched&nbsp;Gundam Wing (2000): Episodes 26 through 30. I'll drop it off in the next couple of days, since mail won't get picked up until Tuesday.&nbsp;Watched&nbsp;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 2 (1997): Episode 7 and South Park: Season 1 (1997): Episodes 3 and 4, streaming on my Roku.<br />
<strong>07/04/2011</strong> (M) - Watched&nbsp;South Park: Season 1 (1997): Episodes 5 and 6, streaing on my laptop.&nbsp;Watched&nbsp;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 2 (1997): Episode 8 streaming on my Roku.<br />
<strong>07/06/2011</strong> (W) - MRNOS.&nbsp;Watched&nbsp;South Park: Season 1 (1997): Episodes 7 and 8, streaming on my Roku.<br />
<strong>07/07/2011</strong> (R) - Received and watched Gundam Wing (2000): Episodes 31 through 35. I'll drop it off tomorrow morning.<br />
<strong>07/08/2011</strong> (F) -&nbsp;Watched&nbsp;South Park: Season 1 (1997): Episode 9, streaming on my Roku. Also watched&nbsp;Repo! The Genetic Opera (2008) on my Roku, and found the movie extremely good. 4 stars since I at least plan on telling others about this. Surprisingly, she's been in nothing I'd consider good (based on a quick glance at titles and some descriptions).<br />
<strong>07/09/2011</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS. Watched&nbsp;South Park: Season 1 (1997): Episodes 10 and 11, streaming on my Roku.<br />
<strong>07/10/2011</strong> (Su) - Streaming on my Roku I watched The Golden Child (1986), which I found to have poor pacing (3/5 stars), South Park: Season 1 (1997): Episodes 12 and 13, which finishes the season and my time with it, and Kick-Ass (2010) which I found to be an extremely good movie. 4 of 5 stars.<br />
<strong>07/11/2011</strong> (M) -&nbsp;Received and watched Gundam Wing (2000): Episodes 36 through 40. I'll drop it off tomorrow morning.<br />
<strong>07/13/2011</strong> (W) - MRNOS. Watched&nbsp;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 2 (1997): Episodes 9 and 10 streaming on my Roku. (And being sick, a bunch of the Ben Heck Show from Revision 3.)&nbsp;Watched&nbsp;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 2 (1997): Episodes 11 and 12 streaming on my Roku.<br />
<strong>07/14/2011</strong> (R) - Received and watched&nbsp;Gundam Wing (2000): Episodes 41 through 45. I'll drop it off tomorrow morning.<br />
<strong>07/15/2011</strong> (F) - Watched Titan A.E. (2000) streaming on my Roku. The audio wasn't in sync and it was an overal 'eh' movie. 3 of 5 stars.<br />
<strong>07/16/2011</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS. Watched&nbsp;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 2 (1997): Episode 13 streaming on my Roku.<br />
<strong>07/18/2011</strong> (M) - Received and watched Gundam Wing (2000); Episodes 46 through 49, which ends the series. 4 of 5 stars, and features a nice bit of backstory, like the fact that White Fang (or the old man) seems to have been the driving force behind the Gundam pilots going to Earth, until the five scientists take control. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>07/20/2011</strong> (W) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>07/21/2011</strong> (R) - Received next movie.<br />
<strong>07/22/2011</strong> (F) - Watched Sleepy Hollow (1999), which was actually pretty good. I was expecting the spirtual element to be fake, but was pleasantly suprised when it turned out that it was not. Initially gave it 3 stars, but bumped up to 4, although that would only last after one additional viewing. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>07/23/2011</strong> (Sa) - Watched Buffy the Vampire Slapyer: Season 2 (1997): Episode 14 streaming on my Roku.<br />
<strong>07/25/2011</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>07/26/2011</strong> (T) - Received and watched Sucker Punch (2011), which is surprising since it just came out, and which I found to be fairly good. At first I was expecting something akin to Brazil, but got something that featured a flashback instead. Not quite the ending I expected, but good nonetheless. 4 of 5 stars. Featured unskipable previews, but fast forward fixed that. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>07/28/2011</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>07/29/2011</strong> (F) - Received next movie. Watched Night of the Comet (1984), streaming on my Roku. It was actually a fairly good zombie movie, where here they're generated by dehydration. 3 of 5 stars.<br />
<strong>07/30/2011</strong> (Sa) - Watched Unknown (2011), which proves that Liam Neeson is becoming a rather good action/thriller/mystery genre actor. 4 of 5 stars. Once again featured unskipable previews. I'll drop off tomorrow or Monday morning. Watched Tales From the Hood (1995) streaming on my Roku, which I had seen before a long time ago, and remembered being interesting (and I wanted something simple before I went to bed). 3 of 5 stars.<br />
<strong>07/31/2011</strong> (Su) - Watched Four Rooms (1995) streaming on my Roku. Fairly good, but once is enough, so 3 of 5 stars.<br />
<strong>08/02/2011</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>08/03/2011</strong> (W) - Received and watched The Lady from Shanghai (1948), which was fine. The twists at the end were nice. 3 of 5 stars. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>08/05/2011</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>08/06/2011</strong> (Sa) - Received next movie.<br />
<strong>08/07/2011</strong> (Su) - Watched In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007), which was actually rather good, and had some fairly big-name talent. 3 of 5 stars, only because I wouldn't watch it again on my own, and I know of no one I'd watch it with (currently). I'll drop it off today or tomorrow morning. Watched Lifeforce (1985) streaming on my Roku. Dan O'Bannon had a part in this one, and I'd honestly say it shows. 3 of 5 stars only because I wouldn't watch it again per se, but it's not too bad.<br />
<strong>08/09/2011</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>08/10/2011</strong> (W) - Received and watched The Last Unicorn (1982), which is as good as a I remember it, though the ending really does come up quickly, doesn't it? 3 of 5 stars. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>08/12/2011</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>08/13/2011</strong> (Sa) - Received next movie.<br />
<strong>08/14/2011</strong> (Su) - Watched House of the Dead (2003), which was another Uwe Boll movie, and wasn't all that bad, although cutting to the game screens was annoying. 3 of 5 stars.<br />
<strong>08/16/2011</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>08/17/2011</strong> (W) - Received and watched The American Nightmare (2000), which was much more about Vietnam than I expected. 2.5 of 5 stars, so 3. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>08/19/2011</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>08/20/2011</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Ichi (2008), which I found to be pretty good. I was initially going to give it 3 stars but decided upon 4 at the last moment. Recommended by Bill Kummer. I'll drop it off Sunday or Monday morning.<br />
<strong>08/21/2011</strong> (Su) - Watched MST3K: Soultaker (1999) streaming on my Roku. I laughed out loud at a handful of parts, so 3 of 5 stars.<br />
<strong>08/23/2011</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>08/24/2011</strong> (W) - Received and watched Religulous (2008) which was interesting, but the focus was odd. 3 of 5 stars. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>08/26/2011</strong> (F) - MRNOS. It was the third on my list for some reason.<br />
<strong>08/27/2011</strong> (Sa) - Received next movie.<br />
<strong>08/28/2011</strong> (Su) - Watched Mad Men: Season 1 (2007): Disc 1, which contained three episodes. Pretty good, but I'm not sure I really want to watch the whole series ... I'll drop it off tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>08/30/2011</strong> (T) - MRNOS. Again, third movie on my list.<br />
<strong>08/31/2011</strong> (W) - Received and watched Near Dark (1987), which was surprisingly good. Lance Henriksen plus a soundtrack provided by Tangerine Dream equals a fairly good experience. The ending is a bit weak, but not too shabby. 4 of 5 stars. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>09/02/2011</strong> (F) - MRNOS.&nbsp;Again, third movie on my list.<br />
<strong>09/03/2011</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched The Informant! (2009), which was slow, but okay. 3 of 5 stars. Watched From Dusk Till Dawn (1996), again, streaming on my Roku. I'll drop it off tomorrow or Monday, but since Monday is Labor Day it won't get picked up until Tuesday.<br />
<strong>09/04/2011</strong> (Su) - Watched Conan the Barbarian (1982) streaming on my Roku. 3 of 5 stars because of length, but otherwise I found it be rather good. Very De Laurentiis-like.<br />
<strong>09/06/2011</strong> (T) - Watched Fire and Ice (1983) streaming on my laptop, since it doesn't want to load on my Roku. 3 of 5 stars since, once again, the ending flies through things. Pacing, folks.<br />
<strong>09/07/2011</strong> (W) - MRNOS. Again, third in my queue.<br />
<strong>09/08/2011</strong> (R) - Received and watched The Happening (2008), which I found to be pretty good, actually. 3 of 5 stars. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>09/10/2011</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS. This time it's the second one! Watched X-Men: Season 1 (1992): Episodes 1 and 2 streaming on my Roku.<br />
<strong>09/12/2011</strong> (M) - Received and watched The Hobbit (1977), which was worse than I expected. Definitely for children who can't read and need something utterly mindless. 2 of 5 stars. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>09/14/2011</strong> (W) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>09/15/2011</strong> (R) - Received next movie.<br />
<strong>09/16/2011</strong> (F) - Watched Ninja Assassin (2009), which was slow at the beginning, and featured a lot of dark fight scenes. What I saw of the action looked good, but that they needed to hide it suggests the quality may not have been there. 3 of 5 stars primarily because I couldn't get a good look at the action. I'll try to drop it off tomorrow before noon (and I succeeded).<br />
<strong>09/17/2011</strong> (Sa) - Watched Kung Pow: Enter the Fist (2002) streaming on my Roku. I laughed at a number of spots, so 3 of 5 stars. Recommended by Jim Behan.<br />
<strong>09/19/2011</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>09/20/2011</strong> (T) - Received and watched Castle: Season 3 (2010): Disc 1: Episodes 1 through 3.<br />
<strong>09/21/2011</strong> (W) - Watched Castle: Season 3 (2010): Disc 1: Episodes 4 through 5. I'll drop off in the mail tomorrow.<br />
<strong>09/23/2011</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>09/24/2011</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Castle: Season 3 (2010): Disc 2: Episodes 6 through 9.<br />
<strong>09/25/2011</strong> (Su) - Watched Castle: Season 3 (2010): Disc 2: Episode 10. I'll drop off the disc on my way to work this morning.</p>
