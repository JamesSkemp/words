<h3>Plan changes</h3>
<p>After many years, on October 7, 2011, I dropped DVDs from my plan. I'm running low on time to get to DVDs with all the great games being released, and the price jump is a bit more than I'd like at this point.</p>
<h3>The times</h3>
<p><strong>09/27/2011</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>09/28/2011</strong> (W) - Received and watched&nbsp;Castle: Season 3 (2010): Disc 3: Episodes 11 and 12.<br />
<strong>09/29/2011</strong> (R) - Watched Castle: Season 3 (2010): Disc 3: Episodes 13 through 15. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>10/01/2011</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>10/03/2011</strong> (M) - Received and watched Castle: Season 3 (2010): Disc 4: Episodes 16 through 18.<br />
<strong>10/04/2011</strong> (T) - Watched Castle: Season 3 (2010): Disc 4: Episodes 19 and 20. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>10/06/2011</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>10/07/2011</strong> (F) - Received next movie.<br />
<strong>10/08/2011</strong> (Sa) - Watched Castle: Season 3 (2010): Disc 5: Episodes 21 through 24, which finishes the season on a bang. I'll drop it off Sunday or Monday. (I did the latter, but since it's Columbus Day, mail isn't going out.)<br />
<strong>10/09/2011</strong> (Su) - Per the advice of Bill Kummer, watched Hobo with a Shotgun (2011) streaming on my Roku. Giving it 2 stars because while the beginning credits were nice, Rutger Hauer and the main female character were both underutilized.<br />
<strong>10/10/2011</strong> (M) - My DVD availability is no more. I now only have streaming access.<br />
<strong>10/11/2011</strong> (T) - Watched Mythbusters: Season 7 (2009): Episodes 1 and 2 streaming on my Roku, after trying a couple other shows out.<br />
<strong>10/12/2011</strong> (W) - Movie received by Netflix.<br />
<strong>10/14/2011</strong> (R) - Watched Mythbusters: Season 7 (2009): Episode 3 streaming on my Roku.<br />
<strong>10/15/2011</strong> (Sa) - While initially being turned off from the series, watched High School of the Dead: Season 1 (2010): Episodes 1 through 6 streaming on my Roku.<br />
<strong>10/16/2011</strong> (Su) - Watched High School of the Dead: Season 1 (2010): Episodes 7 through 12, streaming on my Roku, which finishes the series. 3 of 5 stars, but it would have easily gotten 4 for great animation and a good dub, had the fan service not been so strong.</p>
