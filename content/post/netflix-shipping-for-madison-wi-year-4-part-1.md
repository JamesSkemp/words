<h3>The times</h3>
<p><strong>09/26/2009</strong> (S) - Received next movie.<br />
<strong>09/27/2009</strong> (Su)&nbsp;- Watched Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead (1991), which I didn't want to watch when she got her job, but I remembered how it ended. I'll drop off today or tomorrow morning, in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>09/29/2009</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>09/30/2009</strong> (W) - Received and watched Swamp Thing (1982). An okay Wes Craven B-movie. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>10/02/2009</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>10/03/2009</strong> (Sa) - Received next movie. Watched first two episodes of Cosmos: The Complete Collection (1980).<br />
<strong>10/04/2009</strong> (Su) - Watched Watchmen (2009), which was rather good, but I believe the book was better, especially the attack at the end. I'll drop off tomorrow using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. Watched episodes 3 and 4 of Cosmos: The Complete Collection (1980).<br />
<strong>10/06/2009</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>10/07/2009</strong> (W) - Received and watched Flight of the Conchords: Season 2: Disc 1 (2009), which contained the first six episodes. Music isn't nearly as good as the first seasons. I'll drop off tomorrow using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer.<br />
<strong>10/09/2009</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>10/10/2009</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Flight of the Conchords: Season 2: Disc 2 (2009), including the special features. This season just wasn't as good as the first one was. I'll drop off tomorrow (likely)&nbsp;or Monday. (Ended up dropping off late Saturday night). Watched episode 5 of Cosmos: The Complete Collection (1980) online.<br />
<strong>10/11/2009</strong> (Su) - Watched episode 6 of Cosmos: The Complete Collection (1980) online.<br />
<strong>10/12/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS. They believe I'll receive this on Wednesday.<br />
<strong>10/13/2009</strong> (T) - Received and watched Children of the Corn (1984). Linda Hamilton, outside of being weak, is pretty dang good in this film. This is probably the best film of her, barring perhaps the Terminator films. I'll drop off tomorrow using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>10/15/2009</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>10/16/2009</strong> (F) - Received and watched Critters (1986). The core cast wasn't that bad, and the music was catchy, but a solid B- movie.&nbsp;I'll either let it get picked up tomorrow or drop it off one day this weekend, using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. Watched episode 7 of Cosmos: The Complete Collection (1980) online.<br />
<strong>10/17/2009</strong> (Sa) - Mailer got picked up today. Watched episode 8 of Cosmos: The Complete Collection (1980) online.<br />
<strong>10/19/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS. It was the second on my list.<br />
<strong>10/20/2009</strong> (T) - Netflix shipped the first movie on my list, in addition to having shipped the second one yesterday. Received and watched Cujo (1983), which I realized 5 minutes into I had completely watched not too long ago. Ah well. Still really good, but classic 80s suspense. I'll drop off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>10/22/2009</strong> (R) - MRNOS. Received and watched Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem (2003). Not quite what I was expecting, but the hour and a half flew by. I'll drop off tomorrow using a spare Madison mailer, and not the Kansas City MO mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>10/23/2009</strong> (F) - Received and watched The Naked Gun (1988). A few laughs, now and again. I'll drop off or&nbsp;let it get picked up&nbsp;tomorrow (turned out to be the latter)&nbsp;using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>10/24/2009</strong> (Sa) - Watched episode 9 of Cosmos: The Complete Collection (1980) online.<br />
<strong>10/25/2009</strong> (Su) - Watched Jesus Camp (2006) online. Slow and scary. (And sad.)</p>
<p><strong>10/26/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>10/27/2009</strong> (T) - Netflix shipped another DVD, since the one they shipped yesterday was second on my list. Received next movie.<br />
<strong>10/28/2009</strong> (W) - Watched There Will Be Blood (2007). Having read the novel first, it was far better, and I kept thinking of it, rather than the movie. Otherwise I might have liked it more, had I not liked the father in the book. I'll drop off tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>10/29/2009</strong> (R) - Received and watched&nbsp;Red Planet (2000). Another movie with an ending by Graeme Revell followed by Peter Gabriel. Anyways, realized a couple minutes in that I had in fact watched the movie before, but it was still rather good. I'll drop off tomorrow using the PO Box 2555 Bloomington IL 61702-2555 mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>10/30/2009</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>10/31/2009</strong> (Sa) - Movie received by Netflix. Received and watched Once (2006), which was really quite good. I'll drop off tomorrow or Monday, using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>11/03/2009</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>11/04/2009</strong> (W) - Received and watched Crank 2: High Voltage (2009). Let's be honest, sometimes you just need a movie filled with sex and violence. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>11/06/2009</strong> (F) - MRNOS. Received my instant streaming disc for the PS3 and watched Tattooed Life (1965) on my PS3 with it. Movie seemed to jump around too much, and unfortunately the really great part was at the end. (Once Tetsu had a sword in his hand, he became another man entirely.) Watched The Yes Men (2003) streaming on my PS3. It was okay, but not what I was expecting.<br />
<strong>11/07/2009</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched The Tripper (2007), which had a fairly obvious ending, but it was nonetheless not too bad. I'm going to drop off tonight (before 5:30) in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. Watched 4D Man (1959) streaming on my PS3. The jazz soundtrack was&nbsp;a bit weird, and the CGI was obvious, but the makeup was great.<br />
<strong>11/08/2009</strong> (Su) - Watched The Last Dragon (1985) streaming on my PS3. Great soundtrack, and a not too shabby story. Watched The Toxic Avenger (1985) streaming on my PS3. Orange blood and toplessness; that's about what I expected, and I got that plus a fairly good story. Still interesting that it was licensed for toys and such ...<br />
<strong>11/09/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS. Watched Interview&nbsp;with the Vampire&nbsp;(1994) streaming on my PS3. A little better than I remember it being, with a great cast.<br />
<strong>11/10/2009</strong> (T) - Received and watched The City Of Lost Children (1995). Amazing movie. Amazing. Will drop off tomorrow using Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>11/12/2009</strong> (R) - Watched Class of Nuke 'Em High (1986) streaming on my PS3. Toxic Avenger was better, but I'd watch another Troma film.<br />
<strong>11/13/2009</strong> (F) - MRNOS. Watched LolliLove (2004) streaming on my PS3, which just wasn't all that good. It was probably a 3 star movie, but I gave it 2.<br />
<strong>11/14/2009</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Harlan Ellison: Dreams with Sharp Teeth (2008), which I'll drop off tomorrow or Monday (or let it be picked up since I'm at training next week). It was an interesting documentary.<br />
<strong>11/17/2009</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>11/18/2009</strong> (W) - Received next movie, but it was fairly horribly cracked. Reported and I'll drop in the mail tomorrow using Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>11/19/2009</strong> (R) - Replacement movie shipped, and cracked version received by Netflix.<br />
<strong>11/20/2009</strong> (F) - Received and watched Rescue Me: Season 1: Disc 1: Episodes 1-4 (2004). Really great show, with a really great task. I'll <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">either let it get picked up tomorrow or</span> drop it off as I go in town to sell movies, using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. Watched Primer (2004) streaming on my PS3. Odd that I should add it then, by chance, see the <a href="http://xkcd.com/657/">xkcd</a> comic about it. Confusing, but quite good. Watched The Fly (1958) streaming on my PS3. Not much Vincent Price, but the effects were great.<br />
<strong>11/21/2009</strong> (Sa)&nbsp;- Watched The Quick and the Dead (1995) streaming on my PS3. Great cast, pretty great movie. While Stiletto (2008) seemed to have editing issues at the beginning, turned out to be an interesting movie. Still left too much open. Was it trying to be Kill Bill Volume 1? Either way, Tom Sizemore.<br />
<strong>11/22/2009</strong> (Su) - Watched the worst Batman movie, Batman &amp; Robin (1997) streaming on my PS3. Alicia Silverstone runs like a girl. Watched my copy of Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003).<br />
<strong>11/23/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS. Watched The Girlfriend Experience (2009) streaming on my PS3. Had to read IMDb on this one, although Sasha Grey did a great job acting.<br />
<strong>11/24/2009</strong> (T) - Received and watched Rescue Me: Season 1: Disc 2: Episodes 5-8 (2004). I like the characters, and I'm looking forward to the next disc. Using a Kansas City MO (Box 219788, 64121-9788) mailer instead of the Milwaukee one it came in.</p>
<p><strong>11/26/2009</strong> (R) - Watched Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), which my sister's roommate brought for Thanksgiving (she too is on Netflix). Good - 4/5 stars.<br />
<strong>11/27/2009</strong> (F) - MRNOS. Watched Tokyo! (2008) streaming on my PS3. The end of the first one was when that got good (and this was the strongest of the three, in my opinion), the second one was confusing, and the third was okay. Watched Showdown in Little Tokyo (1991); the only good thing about this movie was Tia Carrere. Watched THX 1138: Special Edition (1971) streaming on my PS3. Wanted to stop watching not too far into it; should have.<br />
<strong>11/28/2009</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Rescue Me: Season 1: Disc 3: Episodes 9-13 (2004). Great show, but the characters are so flawed ... I think I'm going to hold off until I start getting Season 2. I'm going to drop off tonight (but I think I missed the pickup) using&nbsp;a Milwaukee (3079) mailer instead of the Madison one I received it in.<br />
<strong>11/30/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>12/02/2009</strong> (W)&nbsp;- Reported movie as lost, since it's been two days.<br />
<strong>12/03/2009</strong> (R) - Replacement movie shipped. Watched The Mutant Chronicles (2008) streaming on my PS3. If it weren't so dark, and the action didn't jump around so much, it could have been great. Received what I believe is the missing movie; mailer was in semi-crappy shape. Watched My Name is Bruce (2006) streaming on my PS3,&nbsp;which was a passable movie. Watched Tokyo Gore Police (2008) streaming on my PS3, which had a good primary actress, and an okay story, but the execution could have been better.<br />
<strong>12/04/2009</strong> (F) - Watched House of Sand and Fog (2003), which by the end of the film was completely stripped of all happiness. "House of Sand and Fog has all the happiness from the characters stripped away until their lives are as dark as the ending scene; the sadness is so think you can cut it with a knife. But it's still a really good movie."&nbsp;I'll drop off tomorrow, with the replacement, if I get that today.<br />
<strong>12/05/2009</strong> (Sa) - Received what I believe is the replacement movie. Not sure why an extra day has been added to current ship times. Will drop in the mail, probably Monday morning, using a Milwaukee (3079) mailer instead of the Madison one it came in. Watched Operation Condor (1991) streaming on my PS3. Trying to be standard in my ratings, again, so I gave it 3 stars, since Jackie Chan was indeed good, but I don't need to watch again (I would have normally given it 4 stars).<br />
<strong>12/06/2009</strong> (Su) - Watched Contract Killers (2008) streaming on my PS3. Not that bad, and 3 stars under the 'new' system. Watched The Avengers (1998) streaming on my PS3. Thurman and Fiennes made it fairly good. Uma Thurman versus Uma Thurman = Uma Thurman.<br />
<strong>12/07/2009</strong> (M) - Replacement DVD received by Netflix, so I guess that was the missing I received. Watched The Contractor (2007) streaming on my PS3. Not too shabby. Jumped around a bit, and the story was a little weak/disjointed, but the young girl was rather good, and Snipes was okay.<br />
<strong>12/08/2009</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>12/09/2009</strong> (W) - Watched Legend of the Red Dragon (1994) streaming on my PS3. Unfortunately, it was dubbed, and it was a horrible job. Even had it been good, the action/story was okay.&nbsp;2 of 5 stars. Received and watched Sin (2003), which I think was trying to be like Heat in some ways. I'll drop off tomorrow using Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>12/11/2009</strong> (F) - MRNOS. Actually, they shipped the second one on my list.<br />
<strong>12/12/2009</strong> (Sa) - Next movie shipped, since it has to come from somewhere else in the country. Estimated arrival on the 15th.&nbsp;Received and watched The Idiot (1951), which was slow, but good early Toshiro Mifune. I'll drop off Sunday or Monday morning.<br />
<strong>12/13/2009</strong> (Su) - Watched Revolver (2005) again, streaming on my PS3. Ego. Watched Following (1998) streaming on my PS3. Ran into an issue where it had to buffer, but it was due to my connection going down for a bit. Either way, very good movie.<br />
<strong>12/15/2009</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>12/16/2009</strong> (W) - Received next two movies. Watched Jason X (2002), which was what you'd expect, but tongue-in-cheek as well. I'll hold onto until I mail the other I received today.<br />
<strong>12/17/2009</strong> (R) - Watched Kill! (1969), which was really good. The trailer was completely off, however. I'll drop off tomorrow, in the same mailer as the other, using a Milwaukee (3079) mailer. (Actually, I think I let it get picked up instead.)<br />
<strong>12/19/2009</strong> (Sa) - Both movies received by Netflix, and third one on my list shipped for Monday. (The first had a short wait, and the second has a long wait. Done on purpose.)<br />
<strong>12/21/2009</strong> (M) - Interesting. First movie choice shipped today, with an estimated arrival on the 23rd. Received and watched Snakes on a Plane (2006), which really wasn't that bad. I'll drop off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>12/23/2009</strong> (W) - MRNOS. Received next movie, Cardcaptor Sakura: The Movie (1999) but it froze/skipped throughout. Reported, but not getting a replacement (don't understand the story; too much missing backstory). Not rating. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow, unless I have work, using Kansas City MO (PO Box 219788, 64121-9788) mailer I received it in. Watched The Legend of Drunken Master (1994) streaming on my PS3. Would have rated it a 4 before, gave it a 3 now. Pretty good action scenes.<br />
<strong>12/24/2009</strong> (R) - Received and watched Dick Tracy (1990). Why doesn't this get a higher ranking? It's really not that bad. I'll drop off tomorrow on my way north in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.</p>
<p><strong>12/26/2009</strong> (Sa) - Damaged movie received by Netflix.<br />
<strong>12/27/2009</strong> (Su) - Watched my copy of Blade II (2002). Didn't realize Del Toro directed and Ron Perlman starred in.<br />
<strong>12/28/2009</strong> (M) - MRNOS. Watched my copy of Blade: Trinity (2004).<br />
<strong>12/29/2009</strong> (T) - Received and watched Batman Forever (1995). It's amazing how bad the old Batman movies are compared to the new ones. Love the awkward ending themes on this and the other. Adult contemporary? I'll drop off tomorrow using Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>12/31/2009</strong> (R) - MRNOS, with excepted delivery on Saturday (no mail tomorrow).&nbsp;Watched Franklyn (2008) and Joyride (1996) streaming on my PS3. Del Toro's role in the latter was pretty good, and the former was a very odd but interesting movie. Very interesting.<br />
<strong>01/02/2010</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched The Devil's Backbone (2001). Good, but slow. I'll drop off tomorrow or Monday morning.<br />
<strong>01/04/2010</strong> (M) - Watched SNL: The Best of Chris Farley (2000) and Man, Woman and the Wall (2007) streaming on my PS3. Former brought <em>some</em> humor to the end of the day, and the latter was interesting. Asian, and interesting.<br />
<strong>01/05/2010</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>01/06/2010</strong> (W)&nbsp;- Received and watched Gremlins (1984), which is suprisingly PG, with that level of violence and language. I was afraid I had, but I've never watched the whole thing; just a little into the bank scene I think. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I'll drop off tomorrow.</span> (Sick, so I let it be picked up.)&nbsp;And it was a fairly new copy, so maybe they purchased another?<br />
<strong>01/08/2010</strong> (F) - MRNOS. Watched Chocolate (2008) streaming on my PS3. Great Thai action movie, with a fairly okay story. Great choreography.<br />
<strong>01/09/2010</strong> (Sa) - Received and watche The Eye (2007), which was rather good. I like the Blade Trinity Parker Posey more than The Eye one, however. I'll drop off tomorrow or Monday (probably the latter, although I think I may need groceries).<br />
<strong>01/12/2010</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>01/13/2010</strong> (W) - Received and watched Phoenix (1998), which did in fact have a great cast, and was a pretty good movie. I'll drop off tomorrow using Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>01/15/2010</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>01/16/2010</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched The Lower Depths (1957). I seem to only be able to watch 2 hour plus movies if they're good foreign movies. Also watched my copy of Paprika (2007). I forget how good Blu-ray quality is until I see it; too bad the subtitles are hard to read at times. I'll drop the Netflix movie off Monday morning, using Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>01/19/2010</strong> (T) - Watched Godzilla: Final Wars (2004) and The Last Boy Scout (1991) streaming on my PS3. Started doing bad MST3K bits in the last half of the former. The latter wasn't too shabby. Three stars for both.<br />
<strong>01/20/2010</strong> (W) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>01/21/2010</strong> (R) - Received and watched Unstoppable (2004) which was a pretty good Wesley Snipes movie. Not quite as much action as I expected, but a fast pacing and still quite a bit of action. I'll drop off on my way to work tomorrow. Watched episodes 1 and&nbsp;2 of Saturday Night Live: Season 1 (1975) streaming on my PS3. Lot of misses, but some hits.<br />
<strong>01/23/2010</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>01/25/2010</strong> (M) - Received and watched Infernal Affairs (2004) which was a pretty good movie overall. Ended differently than the western version, but not in an altogether bad way. Great ending music, and the clip used a couple times during was pretty good as well. I'll drop off tomorrow using Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.</p>
<p><strong>01/27/2010</strong> (W) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>01/28/2010</strong> (R) - Received and watched The Painted Veil (2006), which was&nbsp;a chick-flick basically, but is nonetheless rather good. I'll drop off tomorrow using an old Lansing MI (30320) mailer instead of the Madison one I received it in. (I want to play some Mass Effect 2.)<br />
<strong>01/30/2010</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS. Visited my mom and we rented two movies from Family Video (first time in a rental place in a long while). Watched Public Enemies (2009), which seemed to jump around quite a bit. Overall not too bad though.<br />
<strong>01/31/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched 9 (2009). Not too bad, but I liked Wall-E better.<br />
<strong>02/01/2010</strong> (M) - Received next movie. Stayed up late and I'm off tomorrow, so ...<br />
<strong>02/02/2010</strong> (T) - Watched Drag Me to Hell (2009). I was hoping she was going to get out of it okay, but that didn't happen. I'll drop off&nbsp;before noon&nbsp;on my way to the grocery store.<br />
<strong>02/03/2010</strong> (W) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>02/04/2010</strong> (R) - Didn't realized Winona Ryder was in Star Trek (2009), which I received today. It was pretty good, but not quite what I was expecting with the time paradox. I'll drop off on my way to work tomorrow.<br />
<strong>02/06/2010</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>02/08/2010</strong> (M) - Received and watched The Triplets of Belleville (2003), which had a very interesting art style and music, but the basically silent-film aspect of it was a little difficult, as well as the odd pacing. I'll drop off tomorrow using Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>02/10/2010</strong> (W) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>02/11/2010</strong> (R) - Received and watched In the Mouth of Madness (1995), which was a pretty good John Carpenter movie. I'll drop off tomorrow, using Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>02/13/2010</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS. Should receive Tuesday (no postal service on Monday).<br />
<strong>02/17/2010</strong> (T) - Received next movie, but didn't get home until late.<br />
<strong>02/17/2010</strong> (W) - Watched The Thin Man (1934), which I have watched before, but which I still enjoy. I'll drop off tomorrow using Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>02/19/2010</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>02/20/2010</strong> (Sa)&nbsp;- Received and watched After the Thin Man (1936), which I hadn't seen, and enjoyed. I'll drop off tomorrow using Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>02/21/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched Howard the Duck (1986) streaming on my PS3. Okay. Lea Thompson was pretty dang good in it. And she even sang. A lot of fairly big names starred&nbsp;too.<br />
<strong>02/22/2010</strong> (M) - Watched A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) streaming on my laptop. Unlike when I tried to watch it on my PS3, this time it had sound. Based on the later movies, I'm not sure the ending makes the most sense?<br />
<strong>02/23/2010</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>02/24/2010</strong> (W) - Received and watched I'm Gonna Git You Sucka (1988), which had a number of fairly funny scenes. I'll drop off tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>02/26/2010</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>02/27/2010</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Another Thin Man (1939), which was yet another great movie. I'll drop off Monday morning in Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. Watched MythBusters: Collection 1: Episodes 1 and 2 (2007) and MythBusters: Big Blasts Collection: Episode 7 (2008)&nbsp;streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>02/28/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched Wild Things (1998) on my laptop. Holy sh*t, that was&nbsp;a pretty great movie. 45 minutes in there's a bombshell, then another 30 minutes later, then nothing but switches. Nice.<br />
<strong>03/02/2010</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>03/03/2010</strong> (W) - Received and watched Ultraviolet (2006), which wasn't horrible, but which wasn't all that wonderful. I'll drop off tomorrow using Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br />
<strong>03/05/2010</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>03/06/2010</strong> (Sa) - Received next movie.<br />
<strong>03/07/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched Suspicion (1941), which I don't think had&nbsp;a very good ending ... (he acted too much like a murderer). Joan Fontaine looked an awful lot like Natalie Wood (as&nbsp;well as a brunette instead of a blonde)&nbsp;during this as well. I'll drop off tomorrow. Watched MyBusters: Collection 1: Episode 9 (2007) streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>03/08/2010</strong> (M) - I thought Trancers (1985), which I watched streaming on my PS3, was going to be a bad (or maybe B-movie)&nbsp;Blade Runner knock-off, but it turned out to be just a bad movie. A young Helen Hunt and some musical pieces happened to be the only good thing about it.<br />
<strong>03/09/2010</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>03/10/2010</strong> (W) - Received and watched Avalon (2001). Was much more of a thinking film than the action one I thought it was going to be. Main actress was stunning, opening/closing credit music was superb, movie itself was&nbsp;a tad confusing. Splash of color in the last bit of time was striking. Not sure about the use of the dog; kept thinking of Ghost in the Shell: Innocence. (And now I know why; Mamoru Oshii played a part in both GitS movies.) Reality ... I'll drop off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>03/11/2010</strong> (R) - Watched Killer Klowns From Outer Space (1988) streaming on my laptop. What a bad movie.<br />
<strong>03/12/2010</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br />
<strong>03/13/2010</strong> (Sa) - Received next movie.<br />
<strong>03/14/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched Scandal (1950). I was expecting them to admit their love at the end, but of course this being Japanese, they don't. I'll drop off today or tomorrow morning, depending upon whether I go out. Watched MythBusters: Collection 1: Episode 12 (2007) streaming on my laptop. Watched MythBusters: Collection 4: Episode 3 (2008) streaming on my laptop. Watched Birthday Girl (2001) streaming on my laptop. It was fairly good; suspenseful. Kidman looked fairly young in this. Watched MythBusters: Collection 2: Episode 4 (2007) streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>03/15/2010</strong> (M) - MRNOS. Watched MythBusters: Collection 3: Episode 8 (2007) streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>03/17/2010</strong> (W) - Received and watched Predator (1987), which was pretty good. I'll drop off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>03/19/2010</strong> (F) - MRNOS. Watched MythBusters: Collection 3: Episode 8 (2007) streaming on my laptop, which was a much older episode.<br />
<strong>03/20/2010</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Doomsday (2008), which was fairly okay, but had some issues around the 1 hour 10 minute mark. Issue reported, and I'll drop off tomorrow or Monday morning, using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. Watched SNL: The Best of John Belushi (2005) and&nbsp;Return of the Living Dead Part II (1988) both streaming on my PS3, and they were both pretty bad movies.<br />
<strong>03/22/2010</strong> (M) - Watched MythBusters: Collection 3: Episodes 7 and 11&nbsp;(2007) streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>03/23/2010</strong> (T) - MRNOS. Watched Episodes 6 and 5 of MythBusters: Big Blasts Collection (2008) streaming on my laptop.<br />
<strong>03/24/2010</strong> (W) - Received and watched District 9 (2009), which was really quite good. Sad, but good. I'll drop off tomorrow using Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.</p>
