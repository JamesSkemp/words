                                The following is a review of the DII 100% Cotton, Machine Washable, Heat Resistant, Everyday Kitchen Basic Oven Mitt, 9 x 8&rdquo;, Set of 2, French Stripe- Chambray Blue, received as part of the Amazon Vine program. What&rsquo;s an oven mitt if it can&rsquo;t keep your hand cool at oven temps? (Since Amazon combines the reviews of a number of other items, if reading this review on Amazon, these are for the 9 x 8&rdquo; oven mitts, specifically the French Stripe, Chambray Blue, style.) Oven mitts have one main purpose, which is to protect one&rsquo;s hands from heat when taking something out of, or putting something into, the oven.

A good basic overview of the Raspberry Pi My experience with the Raspberry Pi is limited to a year of owning three Pi 2s (one that I turned into a backup server, one into a RetroPie machine, and one that never left the box) and one Pi 3 (that I just started to get setup as an updated RetroPie machine).

                                The following is a review of the Treasure Hunter board game, received as part of the Amazon Vine program. Not as complicated as it first seems The last Richard Garfield board game I purchased was King of Tokyo (and the CCGs Magic and Netrunner a long time before that), so I&rsquo;m a little familiar with his games. When I saw that Treasure Hunter one plays two to six players in 40 minutes, I figured this would be a perfect game to play during our weekly game lunches at work.

A cross between an OtterBox and a slim case I&rsquo;ve always preferred slimmer cases for my phones, so when I picked up a Samsung Galaxy S7 a handful of months ago I ultimately decided upon the tech21 EVO ELITE Protectective Case for my device. However, my girlfriend uses an OtterBox, specifically one of the DEFENDER SERIES cases for her Galaxy S6, and I recently picked up a bike, and we were going to be out biking, with our mobile devices in tow.

Slim, with access to all ports, and feels secure When I first picked up my Samsung Galaxy S7 a handful of months ago I naturally needed a case for it. My carrier, US Cellular, had a sale going on, so while I normally wouldn&rsquo;t, I decided to pick up a case for my device in-store.

Complicated instructions The last K&rsquo;NEX set I helped build was for a large rollercoaster, a handful of years ago, and when I was growing up I was more of a LEGO and Technic kid. So given that I was looking forward to building this set, since the rollercoaster was a lot of fun, and the pieces are generally fun to put together.

Surprisingly enjoyable and fair When I was initially reading the rules of Tally Ho! I was admittedly wondering how fair and fun the game was going to be. However, having now played the game I can honestly say it was both enjoyable and fair. Tally Ho! plays out on a large board, with all but one space filled by a double-sided tile.

Interesting, but slightly complex with components that may not last First, I own and play quite a lot of games. But I played Smugglers with someone that I would consider fairly versed with games, and someone who is more into &lsquo;classic&rsquo; games. I was also going to play this with a child aged near the bottom of the recommended age range, but haven&rsquo;t had the chance yet, and might skip it based upon my experiences.

I&rsquo;m pleasantly surprised I&rsquo;ve had my Surface Pro 4 since November 2015, and have been pretty good about keeping it relatively safe. However, the backing was starting to show a little wear the last few months, so when I had the opportunity to try out Case Logic&rsquo;s Kickback (CKSE2197), I decided to do so.

The cookie just seems off Over the last year I&rsquo;ve been having some stomach issues, and while tests seem to have suggested I should be fine, I&rsquo;ve been trying to introduce more gluten free items into my diet. So when I had the opportunity to try Peanut Butter Lance Gluten Free Cookie Sandwiches I decided to do so.

Warm and great length, but scratchy and loosing threads First I have yet to use this blanket outside, and based upon what I&rsquo;ve experienced thus far I probably will not. Not because I don&rsquo;t think it can handle it, but rather because I&rsquo;ve found it to be perfect for use on my couch when I want to lay down with a book.

I just can&rsquo;t get used to the WINGS A number of years ago I had some fantastic earbuds by SONY. They were very simple, but they fit right in my ear, and featured volume controls on the wired connection. Since then I&rsquo;ve hesitant to try other earbuds as less and less feature adjustable volume controls, and I&rsquo;ve never really been interested in Bluetooth ones.

Works, but only at 2.4 GHz Even in my apartment I have a slight dead zone at the farthest end of my apartment. I&rsquo;ve tried using a router to extend my connection in the past, but they&rsquo;ve all required a wired connection to the device itself. With the TP-LINK N300 you simply need to connect it to your wireless router and then plug it into the wall within range.

Nice tight fit for the Alienware Steam Machine ASM100-4980BLK In February of this year I was lucky enough to receive an Alienware Steam Machine ASM100-4980BLK for review. Since I&rsquo;ve been trying to be better about putting away my consoles when I&rsquo;m not actively using them, which I was treating the Alienware Steam Machine as, I was starting to look at picking up or using one of my usual containers for the purpose.

An interesting look at Mamoru Oshii&rsquo;s works Like many others, my first introduction to Mamoru Oshii was via the first Ghost in the Shell movie. At the time I was looking for something like the Matrix, and the Internet of the time highly recommended looking at Ghost in the Shell.

Not as good a fit, but still nigh perfect Right around Christmas I was out shopping around for a replacement to my second generation Nexus 7, due to speed and battery issues. Within a couple days I had picked up one of the 2015 models of the Amazon Fire 7.

A weird hybrid First I&rsquo;ve got to say I&rsquo;m not sure how to review the Alienware Steam Machine ASM100-4980BLK. Do I compare it to the consoles, as that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re trying to make (especially with SteamOS being the OS on this machine)?

If only the hinge were better A few weeks ago I was looking at tablets since my second generation Nexus 7 is starting to get rather slow, and doesn't seem to want to hold a charge as well as it once did.

                                The following is a review of the Fury of Dracula Third Edition Board Game, which I received as part of the Amazon Vine program. So many pieces, but easy after a week I haven't played any of the previous editions of Fury of Dracula, so I can't speak to the changes made in this third edition. However, as I understand it, the game has changed for the better. This supports 2 to 5 players, with one player controlling Dracula and the others controlling one or more of the hunters.

Not what I was expecting For the most part I'm not yet at the point in my life where I need to use a stylus pen for my electronic devices. My fingers are the right size, and with devices getting larger, I don't need the precision. I'm also not much of an artist, so it's not necessary to draw.

I have some barbershop-quality clippers from Wahl that I use for that, and I've had no reason to try anything else.

A sort of board game Resistance Reading through the rules for the first time I kept thinking about the game The Resistance (although there are many games like this). In The Resistance every character is either part of the resistance, or part of a group trying to sabotage them. As the game progresses you start to figure out who's who, in an attempt to score a win for your team.

A good way to get into the genre (I played the Steam version of this game, and this review is based upon that.) This was the first real hidden object game I played, thanks to a kind Reddit user who gifted me a key. It was actually quite good, with great artwork.

Too soon to tell When I saw the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game available from Amazon Vine I jumped on the chance to give it a try. Unfortunately the complexities of the game currently result in this partial review. This review will be updated in the coming days and weeks as we further play the game.

As noted above this is a review of a product I received for free, through Amazon. I try very hard to not let that impact my rating.) Lauge Luchau, the creator of Dimension, was once an architect.

                                The following is a review of Batman Fluxx, received as part of the Amazon Vine program. Not just a minor tweak of Fluxx Ever since I was introduced to Fluxx well over a year ago (I think it was Oz Fluxx) I've been interested in the game. Thus far I've played Oz Fluxx, Zombie Fluxx, Pirate Fluxx, and Cthulhu Fluxx, having purchased the latter in July 2014. When I saw that a copy of Batman Fluxx was up for review I wondered how the game would play compared to the others, and requested a copy.

Can't replace the clam shell models A couple years after college I started hearing about George Foreman's lean, mean, cooking machines. Since I was living alone at the time, and wasn't much of a cook, I decided to try one of the early models, with the plates that could not be removed.

Sounds great to me First, I feel as though any review about audio equipment requires a disclaimer if you're not an audiophile. So, "I'm not an audiophile." That said, after almost a month of using the Sony SRSX55 I can honestly say that it sounds great to me. Thus far I've used the device for playback of music over Bluetooth from an Android device, as well as audio from an Xbox One (plugged via HDMI to a monitor, which output over the speaker connection).

                                The following is a review of the BLU Studio C 5.0-Inch Android Smartphone, received as part of the Amazon Vine program. Very decent entry-level phone First off, as I appear to be unable to use my existing SIM card from my provider with this phone I was unable to use it to make standard calls. However, I did use it for playing music, browsing the web, and Google Hangouts. That said, I was pretty impressed with the BLU Studio C immediately after opening the package as it included both a screen protector as well as clear back case cover.

Another beautiful album Warning: I find music to be very subjective and find it hard to explain why it is that I might like a song in words and without being able to sit someone down and let them listen with me. So the number of music reviews I do is very low. However, this album has been out for three days and has no reviews on Amazon.

Error 0110 When I was building my gaming PC I picked up a Blu-ray drive after a few weeks, to compliment the DVD player, and so I wouldn't need to power on my PlayStation 3 to watch certain movies. However, despite hearing good things about the free options I found the setup to be too large of a pain.

Massive If there's only one thing I could say about the Chill Bag I would simply say that it's massive. While the product name makes note of bean bags, the Chill Bag is instead filled with over 35 pounds of multi-colored pieces of foam, spread out over around 5 square feet, once fully expanded.

A great basic switch It has been many years since I've used a network switch, as wireless has become fast and prevalent enough that most devices are just wireless now. However, since I'm running into an issue where wired computers weren't on the same subnet due to the usage of a router.

Just Delicious Having played the game with three different groups, consisting of 2, 4, and 5 people, I can honestly say that every group I've played it with has had a great time. I won't go into the actual rules, other than to say that they're relatively simple to learn and pick up.

So when I saw this I thought about another machine I could switched from a networked connection to a wireless one.

Fun, but the theme may be an acquired taste Being a fan of the Mars Attacks movie, I was interested in just how well a dice game based upon it would be. The game actually puts you into the role of the Martians, and does not really tie into the movie. This is quite honestly a wise decision on their part, since personally I like playing the bad guys sometimes.

Simple enough for kids, but fun for all A number of years ago I was introduced to the SET Card Game by a former co-worker. SET is fairly basic game that requires a deal of thinking, and is something I really enjoyed playing. So when I saw the SET name on the box for the Karma Card Game I knew I had to request a copy.

A pleasant twist on the SET card game I was introduced to the SET card game a little over four years ago by a former co-worker. Having more experience than I, she kicked my butt every time we played together, but it was enjoyable, and I still did sufficiently good at the single player variant.

                                The following is a review of the LG Electronics Gaming 24GM77 24-Inch Screen LED-Lit Monitor, released in late 2014, and currently available for purchase for a little over $270. The product I received was free as part of the Amazon Vine program. Very nice, but may not be required For context, I have two rather old HP monitors, from 2007, which up until early last year I was using for my PC monitors.

                                The following is a review of LibGDX Game Development Essentials, written by Juwal Bose, and released in December 2014 by Packt Publishing. Difficult to follow, but not a complete waste of time LibGDX Game Development Essentials is hard to follow along with, and since I'm one of those learners who likes to follow along when I'm learning a technology, that made this book troublesome. On the one hand, I certainly got something out of the book, and successfully got a glimpse of just how powerful LibGDX is.

                                The following is a review of Munchkin Panic, provided for free as part of Amazon Vine. Enjoyable even for solo play Thus far I've only been able to play solo games of Munchkin Panic, so this review will be based upon that fact. I've never played Castle Panic, which this game is a variant of, but I'm familiar with Munchkin. So I wasn't quite sure what to expect of this game when I got it.

I somehow made it through the first two levels, and recently opted to run it for a little over an hour today to just get the trading cards (which are worth next to nothing in money and gems). I'm thankful I only paid 17 cents for this, thanks to a bundle.

Makes pushups easy I don't find pushups all that difficult, outside of the fact that I just don't know what to do with my hands. Since my apartment is carpeted, putting my hands into fists results in carpet marks on my ends, and some irritation. As a developer, who works on a computer most of the day, stretching my fingers out causes me some concern as I'm wary of wrist issues.

Fun with a good group When initially reading over the instructions for Cash N Guns I wasn't sure how it would actually play. The idea of robbers trying to split the loot from a heist is pretty easy to understand, but would it play out fairly? Having now played the game in a group of five I think it went fairly well.

An enjoyable story, with minor puzzles I find point and click adventures to be generally enjoyable, but the older I get the more interest I have in the story they tell than the puzzles. So when I finally started playing Gray Matter, which I received for very cheap as part of a bundle, my main focus was on the story.

Call me an impressed Mega Bloks first-timer I'll be honest; I'm a LEGO guy. My sister and I grew up with LEGO, and I have fond memory of them. We did have some Tyco blocks, but we were primarily LEGO. I'm not a fan of Call of Duty, but the set looked pretty interesting, and had a 'less than LEGO' price, I figured it would be worth a try.

So much information Many many years ago I did quite a bit with POV-Ray and Rhino3D, but as I got older focused more and more on the web. While I'd heard of Blender many times in the past, I had also heard that the GUI wasn't exactly friendly for new users.

                                The following is a review of Devil Kings, released in 2005 for the PlayStation 2. Perfectly acceptable example of the genre There's something satisfying about games of this particular genre. You play a kind of super-powered individual, able to wade your way through groups of the enemies armies, fighting your way to their lord(s), and taking them down. It can certainly be repetitive, yet despite that ... the simple controls, basic story lines, multiple characters, and excited announcer, drives you play each character, and at increasing levels of difficulty.

Runs hot, but nice interface and speeds I have a couple routers around the house, but I've always been a fan of Linksys, so when I saw the opportunity to review the Linksys AC1200+ I snapped it up. Unfortunately, while it has a number of good points, I'll ultimately be unplugging it and using an existing device instead.

                                The following is a review of Shadowrun Returns (2013), available for PC on Steam. Enjoyable story and gameplay After having the game for a little over 9 months, I've finally beaten the main campaign, Dead Man's Switch, of Shadowrun Returns (2013). It didn't take this long to beat it because the game wasn't enjoyable, but rather because the machine I had until a few months ago wasn't ideal for gaming, so it wasn't until the last three months that I really got into this.

                                The following is a review of Still Life (2005), available for PC on Steam. Great story, interesting puzzles Having liked Syberia (you have to like a game if you've bought multiple copies over the years), when I saw the Still Life trilogy in a bundle (Post Mortem, Still Life, Still Life 2) a few months ago I decided to pick it up. While it's taken me a while to get to this game (not thinking, I played the second in the series first), I'm glad I finally did.

Actually like it more than my Supcase case The Belkin Universal Case and Cover for 7-Inch and 8-Inch Tablet has a fairly low rating on Amazon as I write this, and has had a low rating since I ordered this a few weeks ago.

                                The following is a review of Fearless Fantasy (2014), available for PC on Steam. Enjoyable, but controls are a bit iffy While Fearless Fantasy isn't long (there's only 13 sections), it's nonetheless an interesting game. The combat mechanic is probably more suited for touch-based devices (I found windowed mode makes the game a little easier, than playing full screen in 1920x1080), it still keeps combat interesting. Because of the mechanic, I did find myself having to grind earlier levels for experience, and ended the game with level 17 characters.

Good story, but iffy controls From the reviews of this game I was expecting a short game with a good story. And having now beat the game in a little over 3 and a half hours (having only looked up if I needed to get off the horse to exit the stage; we'll get to that in a bit), that's exactly what I got.

                                The following is a review of Hexcells Plus (2014), played on the PC. More of the same, with a bit more complexity Having gone through the first Hexcells rather quickly, I just as quickly started playing the standalone Hexcells Plus. While this game contains the same number of puzzles as the original, it adds additional gameplay dynamics. While I finished the first in less than 2 hours, Steam reports that I put in 8 hours on this version.

A short, but enjoyable, puzzle game Ultimately, I recommend Hexcells, especially for the price I paid ($1.25 with the standalone expansion), as I got a around 110 minutes of play. It's a pretty basic puzzle game, with some extra dynamics added in as you progress. I do wish that the puzzles were a little more complex, but I also tend to enjoy this type of game, so the general idea wasn't new to me.

Fantastic music and interesting branching story When I ordered Radiant Historia back in February 2013 I'll readily admit that I played for only a few hours before I let it, and my 3DS, sit and gather dust. At the time the cheapest new copy of the game I could get was $70, so I was expecting much more from the game.

An enjoyable hack and slash dungeon crawler Having recently built a gaming PC I had to think hard about what game(s) I would initially pick up. Since Diablo II was such an enjoyable game, and one of my most memorable experiences when I was PC gaming, I initially looked at Diablo III. However, the current state of the game, and knowing that eventually the DLC and base game would be selling for half the price, led me to look elsewhere.

Excellent primer for your average user In the past I've used Adobe Photoshop for my own personal use, as well as at work for relatively simple work. However, after losing my discount a number of years ago, I've kept my eye open for good alternatives, especially for those that were asking for my recommendation on software.

                                The following is a review of Ghost Trick, released in 2011, for the Nintendo DS. What a very good game A very short while ago I watched a video that featured Ghost Trick briefly, and I fell in love with the graphic style of the game. After ordering it with some other DS games, for use on my 3DS XL, I decided that it would be the first of the batch that I would play, and therefore also one of the first games I had played on the system in months.

                                The following is a review of the Panavise PortaGrip Phone Holder with Windshield Mount, which I received as part of the Amazon Vine program. No suction due to cold, but great grip Right away let me say that I wanted to like this product. Unfortunately, a lack of suction made it impossible for me to fully test this in my car. However, given the weather in Wisconsin, I fully attribute that to the extremely cold weather.

External speaker is key I've tried two different microphones before this headset: the one that came with Warhawk and the PlayStation 3 camera, and since I rarely play multiplayer games, and PlayStation players are less likely to have microphones that Xbox 360 players, both were just fine.

Perfect with my Nexus 7 I currently have a Nexus 7 with a case that allows a certain level of tilting. However, since the case is relatively soft, it doesn't work as well as I'd like. I was also looking at purchasing a larger tablet over the holiday season, so when I saw this up for review I jumped at the opportunity.

Charming Since Watch Dogs was delayed, I've been thinking about what game would be my first PlayStation 4 experience. Between Contrast, Flower, and Resogun, I ultimately decided upon Contrast, since while I had played flOw first on my PlayStation 3, I had already played (and enjoyed) Flower on the PS3, and wanted something slightly different. Contrast is free for PlayStation Plus subscribers, of which I am one of.

A dark masterpiece I picked up a new copy of Alice: Madness Returns for the Xbox 360 back in April of 2012. Since it came with a copy of the original American Mcgee&rsquo;s Alice, I decided to start with that in May. However, it took me until November of that year to beat that game (it was good, just long), and then I didn&rsquo;t start the main game until the middle of August.

Very nice, save the short power cord While I just replaced my router with a MediaLink router (since I wanted wireless N), when Amazon Vine offered this D-Link router I figured I would give it a try, since I had noticed issues with my laptop losing wireless and my tablet experiencing extreme drops.

The .NET Framework is just too big .NET 4.5 came out a short while ago, but the amount I&rsquo;ve been able to do with it has been fairly limited. So when I was asked if I wanted a review copy of Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 Quickstart Cookbook I went ahead and took the opportunity to do so, to see what I could look forward to.

A quick introduction to .NET extension methods In the 5+ years that I&rsquo;ve been doing .NET I&rsquo;ve been created my own extension methods twice. I was already aware that LINQ was built on extension methods, but I very rarely found myself needing to extend something that I didn&rsquo;t already have the code for.

Actually, I did buy the Lara Croft PSN/Xbox Live game, but that&rsquo;s not really a Tomb Raider game in the classic sense. I also received a free copy of Tomb Raider: Underworld via PlayStation Plus, but I&rsquo;ve yet to finish it, and don&rsquo;t have much drive to. However, Tomb Raider is not only the first Lara Croft game I&rsquo;ve paid full price for, but one of a very few games I&rsquo;ve picked up almost immediately after it was released.

                                The following if a review of Milwaukee Mafia (2012), written by Gavin Schmitt. Is a picture worth a thousand words? First, I should note that I&rsquo;ve known the author for around a decade, so my review have some level of bias. Second, having followed the project, and been part of the Kickstarter effort, my experience with the book has been fairly long and diverse. While I was initially expecting a typical, written, book, Milwaukee Mafia, as the fact that it&rsquo;s part of the &lsquo;Images of America&rsquo; series, consists mostly of photos, all with captions, and short introductions beginning each of the six chapters.

AmazonBasics: When price and quality matters While a number of retailers will try to sell you expensive cables, I&rsquo;ve personally found Amazon&rsquo;s AmazonBasics line to be exactly what&rsquo;s needed, at an even better than expected price. This isn&rsquo;t the first HDMI cable I&rsquo;ve received in the AmazonBasics line, but I don&rsquo;t believe my previous cable supported &lsquo;ethernet, 3D, and audio return&rsquo; like this one promises.

A well made cover; one happy purchaser Seeing as how my Nexus 7 has officially converted me to Android tablets (although we&rsquo;ll see what Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface devices are priced at), I figured it was time to finally write a review for the item that&rsquo;s been keeping my iPad safe for almost a year and a half. When I picked up my first-generation iPad I obviously needed something to carry it around in.

                                The following is a review of&nbsp;Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad (2009), for the Xbox 360. Ignore the cover, Onechanbara actually isn&rsquo;t that bad Honestly, I hesitated bringing this up to the counter to pay for it.&nbsp;However, with the 3-point-something rating, new copies selling for over $60, and the store having it used for $6.30, I had to pick up Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad. I&rsquo;ll admit it, as I guy who likes girls sex can get me to purchase something, and Onechanbara certainly promises that.

If you enjoyed The Saboteur, you&rsquo;ll enjoy this While I was playing Mafia II I was constantly reminded of The Saboteur (2009), and since I enjoyed that game, I would consider that a good thing.&nbsp;The game features much of the same, with gun and hand fights (the latter of which plays an important part in the story) and driving.

                                The following is a review of Ninja Blade (2009), for the Xbox 360. A lot of quick time events, but an overlooked gem God of War was a pretty good game, but the game made popular quick time events, which I absolutely despised. When I saw Ninja Blade at a used media store I was taken back by how little it cost, for what seemed like a fairly enjoyable game, similar to Ninja Gaiden (note: Ninja Gaiden 2 for the Xbox 360 is kicking my butt, but I fully plan on finishing it, have picked up Sigma for the PlayStation 3, and am semi-interested in picking up others in the series).

                                The following is a review of Yakuza Dead Souls (2012), released for the PlayStation 3. Inconsistent targeting is easily overlooked in this gem When I first heard about Yakuza Dead Souls I was a little worried. The best part about the Yakuza series is the story, and I feared that they were jumping on the zombie bandwagon (albeit late). However, I should have reminded myself about the multitude of games I have that has the Sega logo on the box, as there was nothing to fear with this iteration in the Yakuza series.

MindJack got a lot of grief when it came out, and it hasn&rsquo;t gotten much better. However, seeing it for under $5 one day, I decided to pick up a copy and see just how bad it really is. MindJack tells the story of a man who&rsquo;s name I can&rsquo;t remember (and that I don&rsquo;t care enough to look up) as he tries to discover what he can, as within the first few minutes of the game he&rsquo;s treated as something of a traitor.

A wonderful short story When Enslaved: Odyssey to the West was first being discussed I was keeping my eye on it, as I had picked up Heavenly Sword when I picked up my PlayStation 3 and thorougly enjoyed it.&nbsp;However, after lackluster reviews I opted to wait until I picked it up.&nbsp;Unfortunately, it took this long to finally do so.

While I had heard of Julie Lerman and her book Programming Entity Framework, after the release of code first I was on the fence on just how much I would get out of the existing book. With the release of&nbsp;Programming Entity Framework: Code First&nbsp;I knew I&rsquo;d learn something, so I picked up an electronic copy (PDF) and started digging in.

Over the top antics delivers just what I needed After the bombardment of commercials online for this game, I had it on my list to pick up after the price dropped into the $20 range. However, since PlayStation 3 users can get a free copy of Saints Row 2 by picking it up before January or February of next year, and the price at retailers had dropped to $40, I decided to pick up a copy early.

Amazing value, for a great RPG A while ago a friend lent me his copy of Dragon Age Origins for the Xbox 360. While I enjoyed the game, I had a number of other games that I was playing, and I returned it without finishing it. With the price drops of the Ultimate Edition, I decided to finally pick up a copy, for the PS3, but it sat unused until a short time ago.

                                The following is a review of The 3rd Birthday for the PlayStation Portable. Fairly incomprehensible story, but wonderful game play Way back in 2005 I found a copy of Parasite Eve. While I tried playing through the game shortly after, it wasn&rsquo;t until many years later that I actually started and finished the game (twice). I also happened to come upon a copy of Parasite Eve 2, but outside of a very little bit of play (less than an hour), I never really got into the game.

                                The following is a review of Yakuza 4 for the PlayStation 3. A masterpiece I picked up Yakuza 4 without having played any of the previous iterations of the game. After looking at reviews online I thought it might have a pretty good story, and provide a good amount of entertainment. After playing a little under an hour of the game I was quite impressed what I had seen. Used copies of Yakuza 3 were available locally, at a pretty decent price, so I decided to pick up a copy of Yakuza 3 and play that first (since Yakuza 1 and 2 were a little harder to find, and more importantly on the PlayStation 2).

                                The following is a review of Last Rebellion for the PlayStation 3. It&rsquo;s interesting how badly this game is generally rated, yet I didn&rsquo;t find the approximately 12 hours I put into the game all that horrible. Sure the graphics don&rsquo;t push the limits of the PlayStation 3, and the game could certainly have been released for the PlayStation 2, but given the current pricing of the game I&rsquo;d argue it&rsquo;s worth a purchase.

                                The following is a review of Yakuza 3, for the PlayStation 3. Around the time Yakuza 4 was being released I began hearing about the game, although after further research I do remember hearing about those who had asked actual Yakuza to play a Yakuza game (the 3rd specifically). Either way, everything I had heard about 4 suggested I would like it, especially when I heard it had a great story.

                                The following is a review of Eat Them!, for the PlayStation 3, and released on the PlayStation Network. I just recently picked up a copy of Eat Them!, for the PlayStation 3, as it was on sale for PlayStation Plus members. According to some Eat Them! is a Rampage-like game, where you control a monster that lays waste to an area of a city. Indeed, this an extremely apt description, as playing this game brought to my mind fond memories of putting quarters/tokens into the Rampage machine, and later playing it, and later releases (such as for the Nintendo 64) to mind.

It is what it is, and that&rsquo;s just fine Years ago I was hooked by the uniqueness of the first few levels of Drakengard, released for the PlayStation 2. When I finally found and picked up a copy I found it had hooked its claws into me even more.&nbsp;So when Drakengard 2 came out I of course picked up a copy.

Enjoyable, but quick, with some annoying platforming As I continue playing games that received less than critical acclaim, I found myself playing Dante&rsquo;s Inferno for the Xbox 360. Dante&rsquo;s Inferno tells the story of Dante who journeys through Hell to save his beloved Beatrice. As we progress through the story we learn more about Dante himself, and why it is that he doesn&rsquo;t seem so out of place in this land.

Darksiders, like Nier, the last game I played through and beat, didn&rsquo;t get all that much respect when it first came out. But Darksiders features more than just God of War meets Zelda gameplay, it tells a story worth seeing through until the end. The following review is based upon a playthrough on the Xbox 360, on the hardest -&nbsp;Apocalyptic - difficulty.

Ys Seven, the first Ys game I&rsquo;ve played, was recommended to me a number of times before I finally picked up a copy. Since XSEED had some hand in the game, I was expecting a fairly good game, and found an excellent one. Ys Seven is a sort of action RPG, with combat taking place on the field, and consisting of standard attacks, dodges, skills, and special attacks.

I&rsquo;ve been working in C# (heavily towards Web usage via ASP.NET) for almost a handful of years now, with the various Wrox books, and online materials, serving me rather well. However, I never really dug &lsquo;deep&rsquo; into C#, and knew that there was a great deal of functionality I just wasn&rsquo;t using. This book, C# in Depth, comes up a lot during discussions of really understanding C#, or the man (legend?) that is Jon Skeet.

A long while back I had first read mention of this book on a blog I subscribed to, the author of whom writes about technology. He briefly mentioned the book before going on to some related discussion. And that&rsquo;s about all I remember. He praised the book, but I can&rsquo;t recall why. Having now finished the book, I can honestly give it some praise as well, but I fear a repeat of what&rsquo;s happened in the past.

Mixed signals lead to a mixed review I think this may technically be the first Eric Meyer book I&rsquo;ve ever read. I&rsquo;ve read a number of his articles online, in various forums, but just haven&rsquo;t gone out of my way to read one of his books. So I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what I was expecting, but I do know it was more then I believe I got.

                                The following is a review of Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep, for the Sony PlayStation Portable. Having played Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 years ago, I skipped most of the other iterations of the Kingdom Hearts series either because I didn&rsquo;t have the console (DS) or because the games just didn&rsquo;t seem to have the same appeal (Chain of Memories). Shortly before picking up my PSP I heard a lot of really great things about this game, with most reviews saying it had a good story, graphics, and an improved combat system, but a quirky camera.

                                This is a review of the Sony PlayStation Portable game Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII. Final Fantasy VII was the game that made me want a PlayStation 1. I played Final Fantasy VII briefly after it was initially released at a friend&rsquo;s house, then my own copies later in college on both the PC and PlayStation 1. So when&nbsp;I ordered a PlayStation Portable (PSP)&nbsp;recently&nbsp;it seemed like a no-brainer to pick up a copy of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII as one of my first games.
