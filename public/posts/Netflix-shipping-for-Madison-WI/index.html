          <p>Over the next couple of weeks, at least, or over the next couple of months, if I'm happy with Netflix, I'll be posting here information about where I received my Netflix movies from, what kind of turn-around I've received, and etcetera.

<p>I've signed up for the $9.99 plan, which offers unlimited rentals, but one DVD out at a time. (<strong>Update:</strong> This also includes 10 hours, per billing period, of online viewing.) (<strong>Update 7/31/2007:</strong> The price went down to $8.99 a month, which also means that there's only 9 hours of online viewing per month. Eh.) I've got 19 movies in my queue - some that I've seen, some that I have not. (Note: queue number is horribly out of date.) Some are classics, some are newer. Some are obscure, some are quite popular. Since I've got a two week preview, I figure I may as well keep the queue nice and full.<!--adsense--></p>
<p>Know of some classic flicks I should see (by classic, in this case, I'll mean pre-1970)? Post them below!&nbsp;</p>

Maybe it's just watching it online, but I just didn't like it ...<br /><strong>07/10/2007</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br /><strong>07/11/2007</strong> (W) - Received and watched Lord of War (2005) and put into the mail to Madison.<br /><strong>07/13/2007</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br /><strong>07/14/2007</strong> (S) - Received and watched Metropolis (2001) and put into the mail to Madison.<br /><strong>07/17/2007</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br /><strong>07/18/2007</strong> (W) - Received and watched A Day at the Races (1937) and put into the mail to Madison.

Similar to Garden State, save the main character feels some kind of fulfillment and ends up leaving at the end.<br /><strong>08/07/2007</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next movie shipped.<br /><strong>08/08/2007</strong> (W) - Received and watched The Yakuza (1975) and put into the mail to Madison.<br /><strong>08/09/2007</strong> (R) - Watched Super Size Me (2004) online.<br /><strong>08/10/2007</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next movie shipped.<br /><strong>08/11/2007</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Lolita (1962) and put into the mail to Madison.<br /><strong>08/14/2007</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next movie shipped.<br /><strong>08/15/2007</strong> (W) - Received and watched 28 Days Later (2002) and put into the mail to Madison. At first, I thought I was going to like Shaun of the Dead more, but I think 28 Days Later ended up being just as good ...<br /><strong>08/17/2007</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next movie shipped.<br /><strong>08/18/2007</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched The Usual Suspects (1995) and put into the mail to Madison. Now, if only I could remember where I had seen this movie before. I didn't think I had seen it, but, from the very beginning, I knew the story ...<br /><strong>08/21/2007</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next movie shipped.<br /><strong>08/22/2007</strong> (W) - Received and watched Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987) and put into the mail to Madison. This is definitely more off the wall (comedic) than the first, but that doesn't mean that it's full of laughs.<br /><strong>08/24/2007</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next movie shipped.<br /><strong>08/25/2007</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Lone Wolf and Cub: Sword of Vengeance (1972) and put into the mail to Madison.<br /><strong>08/28/2007</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next movie shipped.<br /><strong>08/29/2007</strong> (W) - Received next movie from Netflix.<br /><strong>08/30/2007</strong> (R) - Watched Smokin' Aces (2007) and put into the mail to Madison.<br /><strong>08/31/2007</strong> (F) - Watched Man with the Screaming Brain (2005) online.&nbsp; Eh. It's unfortunate that the Sci Fi channel started doing movies, as they should have stuck with what they were best at - showing old television shows and Twilight Zone marathons ... Also watched Coffy (1973) online. Pam was the reason I watched it; well worth the watch.<br /><strong>09/04/2007</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next movie shipped.<br /><strong>09/05/2007</strong> (W) - Received and watched Samurai II: Duel at Ichijoji Template (1955) and put into the mail to Madison. I think, because it's been so long since I watched the first, I've forgotten what the trilogy is about. Truly unfortunate.<br /><strong>09/07/2007</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next movie shipped.<br /><strong>09/08/2007</strong> (Sa) - Received and tried to watch Serial Experiments: Lain: Navi (episodes 1 - 4) (1999). Tried to watch in that I only was able to make it through two episodes. Seems like they're trying to be weird to be weird, and I found it overall <em>very</em> boring ... Put into the mail to Madison. Watched Maxed Out (2006) online.<br /><strong>09/09/2007</strong> (Su) - Watched The Darwin Awards (2005) online. Not always funny, but overall, very good and usually pretty dang funny. When did Ms. Ryder become such an interesting actress? See also her role in A Scanner Darkly, for instance ...<br /><strong>09/11/2007</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next movie shipped.<br /><strong>09/12/2007</strong> (W) - Received movie, but it was damaged (another one cracked in half ...). Reported and put back into the mail. Tried to watch Can Mr. Smith Get to Washington Anymore? (2006), but gave up after 23 minutes; the guy was driving me bonkers.<br /><strong>09/14/2007</strong> (F) - Damaged DVD received, and next one shipped from Kansas City, MO.&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; WTF mate?<br /><strong>09/16/2007</strong> (Su) - Watched Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) online. Pretty dang good movie, not to mention the theme music ...<br /><strong>09/17/2007</strong> (M) - Received and watched Rollerball: Special Edition (1975). I received a return envelope for MO, but I crossed it out and put the Madison address; we'll see what happens.<br /><strong>09/19/2007</strong> (W) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br /><strong>09/20/2007</strong> (R) - Received and watched His Girl Friday (1940). The second time I watched it, and still a classic. Put into the mail to Madison.<br /><strong>09/23/2007</strong> (Su) - Watched Toy Soliders (1991) online. Nope, never watched it before, I guess it was just The Lost Boys (long story).<br /><strong>09/24/2007</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br /><strong>09/25/2007</strong> (T) - Received and watched Tokyo Godfathers (2003). Unlike what you'd think, the movie is very uplifting. 5+ stars. Put into the mail to Madison.</p>
