<p>MRNOS = Movie Received and Next One Shipped</p>
<h3>The times</h3>
<p><strong>03/26/2010</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>03/27/2010</strong> (Sa) - Watched 1408 (2007) at my mom's (via Charter On Demand), which was pretty dang good. Received next movie, but since it's noticeably cracked, and I don't want to risk it, putting it right back in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. Watched BloodRayne (2006), of which the only redeeming factor was Kristanna Loken (and of that, only somewhat), streaming on my laptop. Surprised Michelle Rodriguez was in it, as well as some fairly big names.<br /><strong>03/28/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched MythBusters: Big Blasts Collection: Episode 1 (2008)&nbsp;streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>03/29/2010</strong> (M) - Replacement movie shipped.<br /><strong>03/30/2010</strong> (T) - Damaged movie received by Netflix. Watched MythBusters: Big Blasts Collection: Episodes 9 and 10 (2008) streaming on my laptop. Received and was finally able to watch The Butterfly Effect: Director's Cut (2004). Amazing movie. I'm disappointed I didn't watch it sooner.<br /><strong>04/01/2010</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix, but my next two choices not being available, third movie shipped. (I'm pretty sure it was third.) Watched MythBusters: Collection 4: Episode 5 (2008) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>04/02/2010</strong> (F) - Received and watched Through a Glass Darkly (1961) which was okay, but I probably won't watch the other two films of the trilogy. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow, mailing using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>04/03/2010</strong> (Sa) - Watched Mythbusters: Collection 4: Episodes 8, 1 and 7 (2008) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>04/04/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched Delicatessan (1991) streaming on my laptop. What an interesting movie. Two scenes in the beginning where the characters hear the music and act in time with it is fairly good; too bad it doesn't repeat after that. Watched Mythbusters: Collection 4: Episode 4 (2008) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>04/05/2010</strong> (M) - MRNOS. Watched Tokyo Drifter (1966) streaming on my laptop. I think I watched another (I think even Japanese) film like this, where it seems parts of the movie have been cut. Pretty good. 3 stars. (It was also interesting that you think it's black and white at the beginning, but is in color from the opening on.)<br /><strong>04/06/2010</strong> (T) - Received and watched The Lost Boys (1987), which is still a fantastic movie. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow, as they're doing construction on the road I'd normally take to drop it off. Watched Mythbusters: Collection 4: Episodes 10 and 11 (2008) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>04/07/2010</strong> (W) - Watched Mythbusters: Collection 4: Episode 6 (2008) and Mythbusters: Collection 3: Episode 9 (2007) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>04/08/2010</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>04/09/2010</strong> (F) - For whatever reason, another movie shipped. (Turns out it was because the movie I received &nbsp;today wasn't in slot number 1.)&nbsp;Received and watched Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008). Long movie, and pretty good. Really should watch more Ron Perlman movies soon. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. Watched Mythbusters: Collection 5: Episode 3 (2009) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>04/10/2010</strong> (Sa) - Watched Mythbusters: Collection 5: Episodes 2 and 5 (2009) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>04/11/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched Mythbusters: Collection 5: Episodes 7 and 10&nbsp;(2009) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>04/12/2010</strong> (M) - MRNOS. Received and watched Yakuza Graveyard (1976), which was okay, but a little too ... vague? Was going to ditch the PO Box 94533, Cleveland OH 44101-9979 mailer, but since they shipped another, I'll use it, and let it get picked up tomorrow. Watched Mythbusters: Collection 5: Episode 4 (2009) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>04/13/2010</strong> (T) - Mail person didn't pick up mail, but delivered Smokey and the Bandit: Special Edition (1977), which I watched and enjoyed. Putting both items in Madison mailer I received.<br /><strong>04/15/2010</strong> (R) - Movies received by Netflix and next one shipped. Watched Starz Inside: Comic Books Unbound (2008) and Mythbusters: Collection 5: Episode 8 (2009)&nbsp;streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>04/16/2010</strong> (F) - Watched Moon (2009) streaming on my laptop. Pretty darn good, with music like Solaris (re-make), but not so mystifying that I'd need to watch it a second time. Watched Mythbusters: Collection 5: Episodes 1 and 9 (2009) streaming on my laptop. Received and watched Narc (2002), which was also pretty good. Ray Liotta makeup was top-notch. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow.<br /><strong>04/18/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched Mythbusters: Collection 4: Episode 2 (2008) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>04/19/2010</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>04/20/2010</strong> (T) - Received and watched Kiss of the Dragon (2001), which was pretty darn good. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow.<br /><strong>04/22/2010</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>04/23/2010</strong> (F) - Received and watched Basic Instinct (1992), which was, dare I say, suspenseful, with a great ending. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow.<br /><strong>04/24/2010</strong> (Sa) - Watched Mythbusters: Collection 4: Episode 12 (2008) and Boy Eats&nbsp;Girl (2005), which wasn't too bad,&nbsp;streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>04/25/2010</strong> (Su) - Since Netflix lost track of my rate, watched The Seventh Seal (1957) again, streaming on my laptop. I believe I gave it five stars last time; gave it four this time. Watched Mythbusters: Collection 3: Episode 4 (2007) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>04/26/2010</strong> (M) - MRNOS. Watched Charade (1963) streaming on my laptop, which was full of delightful twists and turns. Watched Mythbusters: Collection 3: Episode 12 (2007) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>04/27/2010</strong> (T) - Received and watched The Number 23 (2007), which was really quite good, with a nice twist at the end, that I wasn't really expecting. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow.<br /><strong>04/28/2010</strong> (W) - Watched Fawlty Towers: The Complete Set Episode 1 (1975), which was pretty funny, and re-watched The IT Crowd (2006): Series 1: Episode 6,&nbsp;streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>04/29/2010</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>04/30/2010</strong> (F) - Received and watched Identity (2003), which was pretty dang good, and seemed to just fly along. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow in Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>05/02/2010</strong> (Su) - Re-watched The IT Crowd: Series 1: Episode 1 and 2&nbsp;(2006) and The IT Crowd: Series 2: Episode 2 (2007), streaming on my PC.<br /><strong>05/03/2010</strong> (M) - MRNOS. Watched Natural City (2003) streaming on my laptop. Okay, albeit a little vague. Borrows heavily from Blade Runner, and others of that genre.<br /><strong>05/04/2010</strong> (T) - Received and watched Zombieland (2009), which was hilarious and a pretty great movie. Would definitely watch again. Had some pretty great songs as well, and Emma Stone looks a little like Bat For Lashes ... I'll let it get picked up tomorrow in Milwaukee (3079) mailer.<br /><strong>05/06/2010</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>05/07/2010</strong> (F) - Received and watched My Young Auntie (1981), which seemed much longer than the 85 minutes it actually is (like almost 40 minutes longer), but the kung fu is pretty darn good. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow, in Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>05/08/2010</strong> (Sa) - Watched 30 Rock: Season 1: Episodes 1 to 6 (2006) streaming on my laptop. Almost died watching Episode 5 (IIRC).<br /><strong>05/09/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched 30 Rock: Season 1: Episodes 7 to 15 (2006) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>05/10/2010</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>05/11/2010</strong> (T) - Additional movie shipped for delivery on the 14th. Received and watched Children of Men (2006), which I didn't quite realize that they had such long takes during it, but mostly did I think and&nbsp;watching the bonus feature made it obvious. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow in Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>05/13/2010</strong> (R) - MRNOS. Watched 30 Rock: Season 1: Episodes 16 to 18 (2006) streaming on my Wii.<br /><strong>05/14/2010</strong> (F) - Received and watched Eerie Indiana (1991), which only contained 3 of the 19 episodes that aired (and these I've all watched and remember, the Forever Ware one the most strongly). Also received and watched The Cannonball Run (1981), which featured a lot of skin, and had me laughing a couple of times, but this one seemed longer than the 96 minute running time. The PO Box 49021, San Jose CA 95161-9959 mailer that I received the first in was ripped, so putting both in a Madison mailer, which I'll drop off tomorrow.<br /><strong>05/15/2010</strong> (Sa) - Watched 2012 (2009) and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)&nbsp;at my mom's. The latter was okay, but I felt much longer than it should have been. Much much longer. The first had a lot of action, and was altogether okay.<br /><strong>05/16/2010</strong> (Su) - Since it turns out I had already seen episodes 6 through 10, watched Top Gear: Series 10: Episode 5 (2007) streaming on my laptop. Watched 30 Rock: Season 1: Episodes 19 through 21 (2006), finishing up the season. Pretty good, but I probably won't be watching any more anytime soon.<br /><strong>05/17/2010</strong> (M) - Both movies received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br /><strong>05/18/2010</strong> (T) - For the first time, movie returned to Netflix before I received it. Re-shipped. Watched The Octagon (1980) streaming on my laptop, which wasn't much of a movie, but wasn't all that bad I suppose.<br /><strong>05/19/2010</strong> (W) - Received and watched My Neighbors the Yamadas (1999). Amazing art design, with differing styles every once in a while. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. (Ended up just dropping it off that night instead.)<br /><strong>05/21/2010</strong> (F) - MRNOS. Watched Top Gear: Series 10: Episodes 1 and 3 (2007) streaming on my laptop. I've seen all the other episodes, including the one that isn't available streaming. Finally started watching Dexter: Season 1: Episodes 1 and 2 (2006). Don't really feel for the main character, but I'll keep watching through at least the season.<br /><strong>05/22/2010</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched The Firemen's Ball (1967), during which I laughed out loud a couple of times, but which I thought was just okay. I'm going to try to drop it off Sunday.<br /><strong>05/23/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched Dexter: Season 1: Episodes 3 and 4 (2006) streaming on my laptop. Getting to like the characters more, but knowing that there's seasons after this one, the suspense isn't <em>quite</em> as strong as it could be. But is still pretty strong.<br /><strong>05/24/2010</strong> (M) - Watched Dexter: Season 1: Episode 5 (2006) streaming on my&nbsp;laptop. Starting to get a little riskier for him.<br /><strong>05/25/2010</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>05/26/2010</strong> (W) - Received and watched Barbarella (1968). PG rating, but the trailer suggested mature audiences. Clearly a movie from the 60s. Pretty good. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow.<br /><strong>05/27/2010</strong> (R) - Watched Dexter: Season 1: Episodes 6 and 7 (2006) streaming on my laptop. Starting to get really good now, with suspense, even though I know he lasts at least a couple more seasons.<br /><strong>05/28/2010</strong> (F) - MRNOS. Watched Dexter: Season 1: Episode 8 (2006) streaing on my laptop. Getting really really good now. Watched Dilbert: The Complete Series: Episodes 1 through 4 (1999) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>05/29/2010</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Super Mario Bros. (1993), which is about what I remembered. Since Monday is probably observed, I'll drop it off in time for a Tuesday pickup.<br /><strong>05/30/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched Dilbert: The Complete Series: Episodes 5 and 6 (1999) and Dexter: Season 1: Episode 9 (2006) streaming on my laptop. Part of me doesn't want to watch the latter any more, because I don't want it to end. After a short break, watched Dexter: Season 1: Episodes 10 through 12 (2006), streaming on my laptop, finishing up the series. Pretty dang good. I'll probably be watching season 2. Watched Dilbert: The Complete Series: Episodes 7 through 10 (1999) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>06/01/2010</strong> (T) - Watched Dilbert: The Complete Series: Episodes&nbsp;11 through 13 (1999) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>06/02/2010</strong> (W) - MRNOS. Watched Dilbert: The Complete Series: Episodes&nbsp;14 through 16 (1999) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>06/03/2010</strong> (R) - Received and watched Wallace &amp; Gromit in Three Amazing Adventures (2001), which was just okay. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow in Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>06/04/2010</strong> (F) - Watched Dilbert: The Complete Series: Episodes&nbsp;17 and 18 (1999) streaming on my laptop, although it appears I've been watching the latter ones in the wrong order.<br /><strong>06/05/2010</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS. Watched Cosmos: The Complete Collection: Episode 10 (1980) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>06/06/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched Gabriel (2007) streaming on my laptop. Pretty good, and basically what I expected for an ending. Watched Cosmos: The Complete Collection: Episode 11 (1980) (although it featured a&nbsp;video of someone using an early&nbsp;version of Netscape)&nbsp;streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>06/07/2010</strong> (M) - Received and watched Black Dynamite (2009), which had&nbsp;a handful of funny parts. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow.<br /><strong>06/09/2010</strong> (W) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>06/10/2010</strong> (R) - Received and watched Tommy Boy (1995), which is a pretty classic Farley and Spade movie; probably the best of theirs. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow, using an old Milwaukee (3079) mailer, instead of the Madison one I received it in.<br /><strong>06/12/2010</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>06/13/2010</strong> (Su) - Tried watching Wisconsin Death Trip (2001) streaming on my laptop, but only suffered around 47 minutes before giving up. Watched The Signal (2006) streaming on my laptop instead, and it was very good. Highly recommend for someone who likes 'smart' horror films.<br /><strong>06/14/2010</strong> (M) - Received and watched Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970). I believe it was Kotaku that featured an article telling Roger Ebert not to review games, and mentioned this in passing, and I'm glad it did. Catching music, a bit disjointed at parts, but fairly okay. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow&nbsp;in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>06/16/2010</strong> (W) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>06/17/2010</strong> (R) - Received and watched Tales from the Darkside: Season 1: Disc 1 (1984). There were more than a couple that I remembered, and definitely some that I must have watched, because they're still fears even today. Episodes, with my thoughts, are as follows; Trick or Treat wasn't that good, The New Man was okay, I'll Give You a Million was okay, Pain Killer was good to okay (Hitchcock-ian), The Odds wasn't too shabby, Mookie and Pookie started an attract female in the lead but was otherwise eh, Slippage I remember fairly well, and Inside the Closet was dang creepy, prooving that it's scarier not to see than to see. I'll let it get picked up tomorow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>06/19/2010</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>06/21/2010</strong> (M) - Received and watched Legion (2010), which was pretty good. I think I liked Gabriel more, but the two aren't quite the same. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow.<br /><strong>06/23/2010</strong> (W) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>06/24/2010</strong> (R) - Received and watched Aeon Flux (2005), which wasn't anywwhere near as 'dumb' as I thought it was going to be. Fairly good science fiction in fact. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow, in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. (Wasn't picked up until Saturday.)<br /><strong>06/26/2010</strong> (Sa) - Watched my copy of Ghost in the Shell (1995), and it's been a while. Still pretty good, but there's some oddities, probably due to the translation.<br /><strong>06/28/2010</strong> (M) - MRNOS. Watched 48 Hrs. (1983) streaming on my laptop. The 80s did have pretty good theme music ...<br /><strong>06/29/2010</strong> (T) - Received and watched Transporter 3 (2008).&nbsp;I get the impression he's an ass in real life, but I'll be the first to admit that I enjoy Jason Statham movies. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>07/01/2010</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>07/02/2010</strong> (F) - Received and watched Dirty Pretty Things (2002). Amazingly good. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow.<br /><strong>07/03/2010</strong> (Sa) - Watched The Gamers: Dorkness Rising (2008) for some reason, and it was actually pretty okay.<br /><strong>07/04/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched Surrogates (2009) streaming on my laptop. Pretty dang good. Watched Cosmos: The Complete Collection: Episode 12 (1980) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>07/05/2010</strong> (M) - Watched the odd Alice (1988) streaming on my laptop. Slow, but very interesting stop-action and design. Watched Gun Sword: Episodes 1 through 3 (2005) streaing on my laptop. Great ending song, and while the first battle made me laugh out loud, it's a pretty addicting show; makes me think of Cowboy Bebop because of why it appears he wears a tuxedo.<br /><strong>07/06/2010</strong> (T) - MRNOS. Watched Gun Sword: Episodes 3 through 7 (2005). Great opening and closing themes and animations, especially the shadowing of characters until they come into play. Looked at purchasing even, but it doesn't look like there's any collections on Amazon or Deep Discount ...<br /><strong>07/07/2010</strong> (W) - Received and watched Fermat's Room (2007), which was a&nbsp;pretty good recommendation from my sister. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. Watched Gun Sword: Episodes 8 and 9 (2005) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>07/08/2010</strong> (R) - Watched Gun Sword: Episodes 10 through 13 (2005) streaming on my laptop. Almost half way through and only one shadow remaining.<br /><strong>07/09/2010</strong> (F) - MRNOS. Watched Gun Sword: Episodes 14 through 23 (2005) streaming on my laptop. They swapped out the opening for a new one, but I think I'm more a fan of the first. Still a great show. After a short break, watched Episodes 24 through 26 (2005), which finished the series. I must have been a junior (and the first semester&nbsp;of that)&nbsp;in college the last time I watched Mallrats (1995), which I watched streaming on my laptop, instead of on a television like last time. Watched Revenge of the Nerds (1984) streaming on my laptop. I didn't think I'd seen the entire thing, but it seems I had. I'm torn on 3 or 4 stars, since I've clearly watched it more than once, and enjoyed watching it ...<br /><strong>07/10/2010</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Capote (2005), which didn't seem nearly as long as it's running time. Good, but one watch is enough. I'll <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">either let it get picked up on Monday or</span> drop it off Sunday.<br /><strong>07/11/2010</strong> (Su) - Finished Cosmos: The Complete Collection (1980), by watching Episode 13. Watched Conan the Destroyer (1984) streaming on my laptop. Pretty good, and definitely a solid action movie. Producer/director seem familar ... (Dino De Laurentiis, who's name was attached to&nbsp;Barbarella)&nbsp;Didn't realize this was the second film before I watched it, but oh well.<br /><strong>07/12/2010</strong> (M) - Watched Targets (1968) streaming on my laptop. Fairly okay.<br /><strong>07/13/2010</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>07/14/2010</strong> (W) - Received and watched Arsenic &amp; Old Lace (1944), which had a weak ending (since it left too much open), but was otherwise frantic and fairly good. The actor playing Dr. Einstein is always a blast as well.<br /><strong>07/16/2010</strong> (F) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>07/17/2010</strong> (Sa) - Watched The IT Crowd: Series 2: Episode 1 (2007) again. Received and watched Before Sunrise (1995). It was okay. I'll let it get picked up Monday or drop it off Sunday using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>07/18/2010</strong> (Su) - Re-watched Blood: The Last Vampire (2000) streaming on my laptop. Changing from five stars to four. Watched The Mask (1994) streaming on my laptop, since it's been a while since I've seen it. Watched Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990) streaming on my laptop, which I'm not too surprised to find I've never seen before.<br /><strong>07/20/2010</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>07/21/2010</strong> (W) - Received and watched The Darjeeling Limited (2007). I'm not sure what to make of it, so giving it 3 stars, but it was probably a 4 star film. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>07/23/2010</strong> (F) - MRNOS. Watched Blood: The Last Vampire (2009) streaming on my laptop. Not at all as good as the animated film. At all.<br /><strong>07/24/2010</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), which was pretty good, until it couldn't play the abduction scene, but ... if&nbsp;I had kids I'd watch it again. I'll let it get picked up Monday or drop it off Sunday, in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>07/25/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched Pusher (1996) streaming on my laptop. Neither the good nor the bad are free from the hand of fate. Watched Them (2007) streaming on my laptop. Really good, although about what I expected 'them' to be.<br /><strong>07/27/2010</strong> (T) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>07/28/2010</strong> (W) - Received and watched Run Lola Run (1998) again. Bumping down to 4 stars, but I still really like it (and don't regret getting it again). I'll let it get picked up tomorrow, in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>07/30/2010</strong> (F) - MRNOS. Watched The Crimson Rivers (2000) streaming on my laptop. Surprise at the end (which&nbsp;made things&nbsp;consistent),&nbsp;and definitely very good. Watched Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995) streaming on my laptop. Now I've (finally) watched all the Die Hard films.<br /><strong>07/31/2010</strong> (Sa) - Real next movie shipped. I received the movie shipped yesterday, but since I wasn't home ...<br /><strong>08/01/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched Down in the Valley (2005), which was sad, but inconsistent. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow.<br /><strong>08/03/2010</strong> (T) - MRNOS, surprisingly. Received and watched 21 Grams (2003), which was good, but too disjointed for too long, for me. Understandable at the end, but to what end? I'll let it get picked up tomorrow in the PO Box 548008, Flushing NY 11354-8008 mailer I received it in, since they sent me another.<br /><strong>08/04/2010</strong> (W) - Received next movie, but don't feel like watching it tonight.<br /><strong>08/05/2010</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix. Watched MirrorMask (2005), which was really odd, but also really good. I'll let it get picked up, or drop it off, tomorrow, using the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I recieved it in. Probably the latter since I have to go to the bank anyways.<br /><strong>08/06/2010</strong> (F) - Received Breaking Bad from <a rel="external" href="http://rmlumley.com/">Rob Lumley</a>, and watched Season 1: Episode 1 (2008). Just okay.<br /><strong>08/07/2010</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS. Watched The IT Crowd: Season 4: Episodes 1 and 2&nbsp;(2010) thanks to <a rel="external" href="http://mrrofl.com/">Dan Conderman</a>.<br /><strong>08/08/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched Starz Inside: Fantastic Flesh (2008) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>08/09/2010</strong> (M) - Received and watched Sherlock Holmes (2009), which was pretty good, as a smart action movie. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>08/10/2010</strong> (T) - Watched Breaking Bad Season 1: Episode 2 (2008) which was better than the first. I could get into the show, but I'm going to opt not to.<br /><strong>08/11/2010</strong> (W) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>08/12/2010</strong> (R) - Received and watched The Goonies (1985), which was pretty good (all that profanity and up skirts though, for a PG film ...), and which I'll let get picked up tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>08/13/2010</strong> (F) - Watched The IT Crowd: Season 4: Episodes 3 and 4 (2010).<br /><strong>08/14/2010</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS. Watched The IT Crowd: Season 4: Episodes 5 and 6 (2010), again thanks to Dan Conderman. Moss in the court room of the last episode was hilarious. Received my new copy of The Bourne Trilogy in the mail today, and watched The Bourne Identity (2002). Worth the purchase; it's a pretty good movie.<br /><strong>08/15/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007).<br /><strong>08/16/2010</strong> (M) - Received and watched Death Race (2008), which seemed a bit jerky with the story, but it was okay. I'll let it get picked up tomorrow.<br /><strong>08/18/2010</strong> (W) - Movie received by Netflix and second one in my queue shipped.<br /><strong>08/19/2010</strong> (R) - Next movie shipped. Received and watched Michael Jackson: Moonwalker (1988), which I can now say I've watched. Other than just playing clips, I liked the beginning and the first song during the credits more, but now I at least under the Moonwalker game ... I'll drop it off tomorrow morning in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>08/21/2010</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS. Watched Fright Night (1985), which I've seen on television before, a long time ago.<br /><strong>08/23/2010</strong> (M) - Received next two movies, but not enough time to watch either.<br /><strong>08/24/2010</strong> (T) - Watched Full Metal Yakuza (1997) first, which was very eh. I'm going to toss the PO Box 46740 Greensboro NC 27499-3632 mailer I received it in. Watched eXistenZ (1999), which all made sense at the end. Tough call, but I'll give it 3.5, so 4 stars. Putting both in a Milwaukee (3079) mailer (which is from the latter movie).<br /><strong>08/25/2010</strong> (W) - MRNOS (that's both movies of course).<br /><strong>08/26/2010</strong> (R) - Received and watched Defendor (2009), which was actually pretty good. Woody Harrelson did a really good job, and Metric closing song? That's not too bad either ... I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br /><strong>08/28/2010</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>08/30/2010</strong> (M) - Received and watched National Lampoon's Animal House (1978). Eh. I'll drop it off tomorrow in Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>09/01/2010</strong> (W) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>09/02/2010</strong> (R) - Received and watched Blood and Bone (2009), which had some really good action scenes, and seems quasi-early Bruce Lee/Asian in nature. I'll drop it off tomorrow in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>09/03/2010</strong> (F) - Watched The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) streaming on my laptop. Wes Anderson movies are unique; great music choices.<br /><strong>09/04/2010</strong> (Sa) - MRNOS (for Tuesday). Watched Machete (2010) at the theatre, which is the first in a long while. $15 ($12 of which was with a gift card) for an 'eh' movie, not that I needed a reminder for why I stopped watching movies that way.<br /><strong>09/06/2010</strong> (M) - Watched Futurama: Volume 1: Episode 1 (1999) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>09/07/2010</strong> (T) - Received and watched Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), which was pretty good, even though switching over to Japanese caused the movie to skip forward dozens of minutes at a time. I'll drop it off tomorrow.<br /><strong>09/08/2010</strong> (W) - Watched Futurama: Volume 1: Episodes 2 through 4 (1999) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>09/09/2010</strong> (R) - MRNOS. Watched Futurama: Volume 1: Episode 5 (1999) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>09/10/2010</strong> (F) - Received next movie.<br /><strong>09/11/2010</strong> (Sa) - Watched Sleep Dealer (2008), which was pretty good. Boy brings about father's death, leaves to try to make money, meets girl, and convinces father's drone-piloting killer to ease the suffering of his family. I think I've seen the main female actress before, but ... I'll let it get picked up today in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. Watched Futurama: Season 1: Episode 6 (1999) streaming on my laptop. Watched Futurama: Season 1: Episodes 7 through 9 (1999) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>09/12/2010</strong> (Su) - Watched Futurama: Season 1: Episodes 10 through 13 (1999) streaming on my laptop, which finishes the season.<br /><strong>09/13/2010</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>09/14/2010</strong> (T) - Received and watched Gone in 60 Seconds (1974), which was pretty good, although I expected him to get caught at the end. I'll drop it off tomorrow, in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>09/16/2010</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>09/17/2010</strong> (F) - Received and watched Attack of the Killer Tomatoes (1978), which just wasn't good.&nbsp;I'll drop it off tomorrow when I deposit a check.<br /><strong>09/18/2010</strong> (Sa) - Watched Dogtown and Z-Boys (2002) streaming on my laptop.<br /><strong>09/20/2010</strong> (M) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>09/21/2010</strong> (T) - Received and watched The Lost Room: Episodes 1 through 4 (2006). Really great series. Only wish I could remember why I put them in my queue ... I'll drop off tomorrow in Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.<br /><strong>09/23/2010</strong> (R) - MRNOS.<br /><strong>09/24/2010</strong> (F) - Received next movie.<br /><strong>09/25/2010</strong> (Sa) - Watched The Lost Room: Episodes 5 through 6 (2006). Good series, but the ending isn't very good. Far too many loose ends ... I'll let it get picked up today in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in. Watched The Virgin Spring (1960) streaming on my laptop. All-in-all, I like Bergman's works, especially when they feature Max von Sydow.</p>
