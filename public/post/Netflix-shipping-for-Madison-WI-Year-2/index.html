I had previously written on <a href="http://words.strivinglife.com/words/post/Netflix-shipping-for-Madison-WI.aspx">how Netflix shipped and received DVDs, for Madison WI</a>. This article continues that one, by discussing Year 2 with Netflix (first year began September 26, 2006). 
</p>
<h3>Plan changes</h3>
<p>
On December 2, 2007, I decided to upgrade to the two at-a-time (unlimited)&nbsp;plan. Since my plan begins on the 10th of each month, that means I had to pay an extra $1.26 to upgrade now, instead of for the next month (I figure this way they&#39;ll send a movie out tomorrow morning). 
</p>
<p>
As of January 10, 2008, I&#39;ll be back on the 1-unlimited plan, since House should be back on the air. As always, I&#39;ll continue to track my progress below. 
</p>
<p>
As of February 22, 2008, I&#39;m back to 2-unlimited. 
</p>
<p>
As of April 28, 2008, House is back on, but on Mondays. Since I get so few movies on Monday, I&#39;ll be staying with the 2-unlimited plan. 
</p>
<p>
As of May 7, 2008, since I&#39;m getting busier, I&#39;m downgrading to the 1-unlimited plan, as of May 10. 
</p>
<p>
As of July 25, 2008, I&#39;m back to 2-unlimited. I&#39;ve got almost 200 movies in my queue, so I got to knock that down a bit. 
</p>
<p>
<strike>I changed my plan back to 1-unlimited August 29, 2008, and that should take effect September 10.</strike> When I received my confirmation email, it seems that on 9/10 I&#39;ll get my 15% discount, because of the shipping problems. However, that applies to that month&#39;s plan price. Switched back to 2-unlimited.

<p>
<strong>09/27/2007</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>09/28/2007</strong> (F) - Received next movie.<br />
<strong>09/29/2007</strong> (Sa) - Watched GoodFellas (1990) and put into the mail to Madison.<br />
<strong>10/01/2007</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>10/02/2007</strong> (T) - Received and watched Outlaw Star: Vol. 1: Disc 2 and put into the mail to Madison.<br />
<strong>10/04/2007</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>10/05/2007</strong> (F) - Received and watched the very excellent 3 Days of the Condor. Wow. Put into the mail to Madison.<br />
<strong>10/08/2007</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix, and next one shipped. The email says I can expect delivery on Wednesday. This day is a Federal holiday, hence no mail.<br />
<strong>10/09/2007</strong> (T) - Received next movie.<br />
<strong>10/10/2007</strong> (W) - Watched Constantine (2005) and put into the mail to Madison. Great movie, but for some reason I couldn&#39;t give a 5/5, as much as I&#39;d really like to ...<br />
<strong>10/12/2007</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>10/13/2007</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched The Island (2005) and put into the mail to Madison.<br />
<strong>10/15/2007</strong> (M) - Watched Six-String Samurai (1998) online. The moral? Stay away from attachments; they&#39;ll kill you dead.<br />
<strong>10/16/2007</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>10/17/2007</strong> (W) - Received and watched The Magnificent Seven (1960) and put into the mail to Madison. I think I liked the original more, since it&#39;s rather Americanized.<br />
<strong>10/19/2007</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>10/20/2007</strong> (Sa) - Received next movie,&nbsp;but watched The Brood (1979) first, which Rob Lumley was kind enough to lend me. The one thing I don&#39;t like about the movie is the ending; I&#39;m not sure why we&#39;re shown what we&#39;re shown (are they more than tears?) ...<br />
<strong>10/21/2007</strong> (Su) - Watched Dawn of the Dead (1978) (European Version) and put into the mail to Madison.<br />
<strong>10/23/2007</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>10/24/2007</strong> (W) - Received and watched My Girl (1991) and put into the mail to Madison. <br />
<strong>10/26/2007</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>10/27/2007</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Army of Darkness (1993) and put into the mail to Madison. No, they probably couldn&#39;t throw together any more one-liners ... <br />
<strong>10/28/2007</strong> (Su) - Watched The Gospel According to Philip K. Dick (2000)&nbsp;online. Worst animations ever.<br />
<strong>10/29/2007</strong> (M)&nbsp;- Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>10/31/2007</strong> (W) - Received and watched the kick-a** Hot Fuzz (2007). Too bad they leave a plot point open, but ... Put into the mail to Madison.<br />
<strong>11/02/2007</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>11/03/2007</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched the Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s (1961) and put into the mail to Madison. However, part of the movie didn&#39;t play. Nonetheless, it was rather good.<br />
<strong>11/06/2007</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>11/07/2007</strong> (W) - Received and watched Shoot the Piano Player (1960). I think this was the first French movie I&#39;ve seen, and I rather liked it. Put into the mail to Madison.<br />
<strong>11/09/2007</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>11/10/2007</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Casablanca (1942). I should have watched it earlier. Put into the mail to Madison, but since there&#39;s no mail Monday ...<br />
<strong>11/15/2007</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix and the next one was shipped, since the mail person decided not to pick up outgoing mail on Tuesday ...<br />
<strong>11/16/2007</strong> (F) - Received and watched Death Proof (2007). Unfortunately, when this came out my sister said she&#39;d watch Grindhouse with me, and I believed her. I don&#39;t know what was added on, but this film was longer than it needed to be. But, was fairly good. Put into the mail to Madison.<br />
<strong>11/21/2007</strong> (W) - Reported DVD as lost in the mail, since they <em>still</em> haven&#39;t received it.<br />
<strong>11/22/2007</strong> (R) - Watched Live Free or Die Hard (2007) outside of Netflix.<br />
<strong>11/23/2007</strong> (F)&nbsp;- Next movie shipped by Netflix.<br />
<strong>11/24/2007</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched A Hard Day&#39;s Night (1964) and put into the mail to Madison.<br />
<strong>11/27/2007</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>11/28/2007</strong> (W) - Received and watched Transformers (2007) and put into the mail to Madison. Long, but rather good; 4.5 if I could, 4 because I couldn&#39;t.<br />
<strong>11/29/2007</strong> (R) - Watched Requiem for a Dream (2000), outside of Netflix, thanks to Mr. Rob Lumley.<br />
<strong>11/30/2007</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>12/01/2007</strong> (Sa) - Watched Time Bandits (1981) online. Cool opening and closing songs, but I&#39;m confused by the ending ... Also watched Gilbert Gottfried: Dirty Jokes (2005) online (eh) and received the next movie from Netflix.<br />
<strong>12/02/2007</strong> (Su) - Watched The Transporter (2002) and put into the mail to Madison. It was my first Blu-ray DVD, and I had some issues with it on my Playstation 3. The quality was good, but I couldn&#39;t get the main DVD menu to display. I did end up getting a smaller menu to come up, but I think it was just from what the PS3 read off of the DVD itself. When I went back in to review them ... no go. However, the audio was fine. I think Jason Statham is one of my favorite actors ...<br />
<strong>12/03/2007</strong> (M) - Next film mailed by Netflix.<br />
<strong>12/04/2007</strong> (T) - Received and watched Le Samourai (1967) and put into the mail to Madison. Another French film. And, rather good. However, I feel as though I&#39;m missing something ... (a visit to the Wiki cleared it up, but a watching of the films included with the Criterion disc would also seem to do the same).&nbsp;Netflix also received the previous film, and put the next into the mail.<br />
<strong>12/05/2007</strong> (W) - Received and watched Planet Terror (2007) and put into the mail to Madison. Better than Death Proof,&nbsp;in my opinion.<br />
<strong>12/06/2007</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix, and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>12/07/2007</strong> (F) - Received next movie from Netflix, and Netflix received and mailed another movie.<br />
<strong>12/08/2007</strong> (Sa) - Watched Daisies (1966) and put into the mail to Madison. My first Czech film. Received next movie from Netflix.<br />
<strong>12/09/2007</strong> (Su) - Watched Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) and put into the mail to Madison.<br />
<strong>12/10/2007</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix, and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>12/11/2007</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix, and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>12/12/2007</strong> (W) - Received and watched Formula 51 (2001) and the other next movie (due to mail not being delivered Tuesday, for some reason). Put Formula 51 into the mail to Madison.<br />
<strong>12/13/2007</strong> (R) - Watched Who Killed the Electric Car? (2006) and put into the mail to Madison. Utterly depressing how dead the spirits of some men&nbsp;are ...<br />
<strong>12/14/2007</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>12/15/2007</strong> (Sa) - Watched Sideways (2004), leant to me by Rob Lumley. Not quite sure what to think of the movie in whole ... Received next movie from Netflix. Watched The Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933).<br />
<strong>12/16/2007</strong> (Su) - Watched House of Wax (1953) and put into the mail to Madison.<br />
<strong>12/17/2007</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>12/18/2007</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Received and watched Stranger than Fiction (2006), and put into the mail to Madison. One of the most wonderful films I&#39;ve seen in a very long time.<br />
<strong>12/19/2007</strong> (W) - Received next movie, but watched Blade Runner: Final Cut (2007) in the theatre instead.<br />
<strong>12/20/2007</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Watched Samurai Rebellion (1967) and put into the mail to Madison. Watched American Beauty (1999), thanks again to the tastes of Rob Lumley.<br />

<strong>12/22/2007</strong> (Sa) - Watched Samurai Champloo: Volume 2 (2004) and put into the mail to Milwaukee. Saw Sweeny Todd (2007) at Star Cinema. Marcus Theatres decided not to spend the money to pick it up.<br />

<strong>12/24/2007</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped (for Wednesday). Watched Magnolia (1999), another courtesy of Rob Lumley.<br />

<strong>12/31/2007</strong> (M) - Watched Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask (1972) courtesy of Rob Lumley. Yawn.<br />
<strong>01/01/2008</strong> (T) - Watched Sleeper (1973), courtesy of Rob Lumley.<br />
<strong>01/02/2008</strong> (W) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Watched Corpse Bride (2005), which my sister had given to me for Christmas.<br />
<strong>01/03/2008</strong> (R) - Received DVD, but it was cracked. Reported the problem and put into the mail to Madison.<br />
<strong>01/05/2008</strong> (Sa) - Received replacement DVD. Netflix still hasn&#39;t received Ray, so I reported it missing/lost. Watched Samurai Champloo: Volume 3 (2004) and put into the mail to Madison.<br />
<strong>01/07/2008</strong> (M) - Damaged DVD received by Netflix, and next one (movie, not damaged, hopefully ;) )&nbsp;shipped.<br />
<strong>01/08/2008</strong> (T) - Movied received by Netflix. Received and watched Final Destination (2000), which I guess I have watched all the way through before, and put into the mail to Madison. Next movie shipped by Netflix.<br />
<strong>01/09/2008</strong> (W) - Received and watched Samurai Champloo: Volume 4 (2004) and put into the mail to Madison. I picked up the set through Amazon, so I won&#39;t be viewing any more through Netflix.<br />
<strong>01/10/2008</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix, but since my one-at-a-time plan starts today ... Watched Annie Hall, courtesy of Rob Lumley.<br />
<strong>01/11/2008</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>01/12/2008</strong> (Sa) - Received next movie.<br />
<strong>01/13/2008</strong> (Su) - Watched No End in Sight (2007) and put into the mail to Madison.<br />
<strong>01/14/2008</strong> (M) - Watched Manhattan (1979), courtesy of Rob Lumley. Unfortunately, perhaps, I just wanted it to end ...<br />
<strong>01/16/2008</strong> (W) - Having bought Stranger Than Fiction on Blu-ray, watched the film again with my sister. She pulled a Dan Conderman and fell asleep during a great movie.<br />
<strong>01/17/2008</strong> (R) - Reported DVD lost, since Netflix still hasn&#39;t received it ...<br />
<strong>01/18/2008</strong> (F) - Next movie sent by Netflix.<br />
<strong>01/19/2008</strong> (Sa) - Received Grateful Dawg (2000) and put into the mail to Milwaukee. However, it won&#39;t go out until Tuesday ... I may drop it off at the post office instead.<br />
<strong>01/24/2008</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped (although they report on the site that it went out yesterday). Received and watched Escape From&nbsp;New York (1981). Why do John Carpenter&#39;s early movies have such great soundtracks? Because he did them. I&#39;ll be dropping this off at the post office, I think, mailing to Madison.<br />
<strong>01/28/2008</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>01/29/2008</strong> (T) - Received next movie. Holding off on watching until tomorrow, since House is on tonight (finally).<br />
<strong>01/30/2008</strong> (W) - Watched Silent Running (1971). Eh. Not sure how it got it&#39;s cult ranking. Put into the mail to Madison.<br />
<strong>02/01/2008</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>02/02/2008</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched The Silence of the Lambs (1991). I can remember the movie poster, but never watched the movie until now. Unfortunate. I&#39;ll probably drop by the post office on Monday morning.<br />
<strong>02/05/2008</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>02/06/2008</strong> (W) - Received and watched Escape From L.A. (1996) and put into the mail to Madison. Contrary to many reviews, a very good movie, having watched New York.<br />
<strong>02/08/2008</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>02/09/2008</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Serpico (1973). Either way, it&#39;ll be picked up Monday (mailing to Madison). Very good movie.<br />
<strong>02/12/2008</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>02/13/2008</strong> (W) - Received and watched Zatoichi 1: The Tale of Zatoichi (1962) and put into the mail to Madison.<br />
<strong>02/15/2008</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>02/16/2008</strong> (Sa) - Received next movie.<br />
<strong>02/17/2008</strong> (Su) - Watched Zatoichi 2: The Tale of Zatoichi Continues (1962) and put into the mail to Madison. Watched The NeverEnding Story (1984)&nbsp;online. Robot Chicken plus my tiredness made it into a disfigured comedy. Those crazy Germans. Watched Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself (2005) online. The first one was great, the others were okay.<br />
<strong>02/18/2008</strong> (M) - Watched Hellraiser (1987) online. Definitely seen most of this before, but ...<br />
<strong>02/20/2008</strong> (W) - Watched Strangers on a Train (1951) online. Watched The Red Balloon (1953) online as well. Didn&#39;t watch White Mane (it was a double feature, so ... might as well clarify).<br />
<strong>02/22/2008</strong> (F) - Reported Zatoichi 2 as lost in the mail. Upgraded to 2-unlimited plan. Next two movies shipped.<br />
<strong>02/23/2008</strong> (Sa) - Received two movies. Watched Zatoichi 3: New Tale of Zatoichi (1963). I plan on watching the other movie tonight/tomorrow, and putting both in the mail in the same envelope.<br />
<strong>02/24/2008</strong> (Su) - Watched Oldboy (2003). I&#39;ll be dropping both movies off tomorrow morning, at the post office. The movie didn&#39;t end as I first expected, and I believe I&#39;ll end up watching this movie again.<br />
<strong>02/25/2008</strong> (M) - Watched Stephen King&#39;s Cat&#39;s Eye (1985) online.<br />
<strong>02/26/2008</strong> (T) - Movies received by Netflix, and next ones shipped. Watched Trial and Error (1997) courtesy of Daniel Conderman. I was confused why Charlize Theron wasn&#39;t on the cover, but she doesn&#39;t have a lot of screen time, so it makes sense, I suppose.<br />
<strong>02/27/2008</strong> (W) - Received next two movies. Watched Adaptation (2002), which I&#39;ll drop off at the post office tomorrow. &quot;You are what you love, not what loves you.&quot;<br />
<strong>02/29/2008</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix, and next one shipped. Watched Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002). What&#39;s especially interesting is that the two main male characters are in fact, in&nbsp;a way, both good. I&#39;ll drop this off at the post office tomorrow morning.<br />
<strong>03/01/2008</strong> (Sa) - Received Next (2007), which I&#39;ll be dropping off at the post office by Monday morning. I wasn&#39;t expecting as much from this P.K.D.-based movie, but I dare say it was quite good.<br />
<strong>03/03/2008</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>03/04/2008</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Received next movie from Netflix, but I didn&#39;t have time to watch it.<br />
<strong>03/05/2008</strong> (W) - Received second movie from Netflix, The Conversation (1974), which I&#39;ll drop off at the post office tomorrow morning.<br />
<strong>03/06/2008</strong> (R) - Watched Lady Vengeance (2005), which is also referred to as Sympathy for Lady Vengeance in the film.

<strong>08/27/2008</strong> (W) - Received and watched Assault on Precinct 13 (2005), a pretty faithful, interesting, re-make.<br />
<strong>08/28/2008</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix, and a surprising movie shipped (it was just released and had a long wait listed ...).<br />
<strong>08/29/2008</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Received and watched Afro Samurai (2007). Nice style to it. I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow probably.<br />
<strong>08/30/2008</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Wild Strawberries (1957). Mailing in a Lansing MI mailer, instead of the Madison mailer. Dropped this and the other off today, before the 8 pm pickup. Watched Beetlejuice (1988) online. Other than the opening, about as I remember it, although I don&#39;t remember Keaton being Beetlejuice ...<br />
<strong>08/31/2008</strong> (Su) - Watched Superfly (1972) online.<br />
<strong>09/01/2008</strong> (M) - Watched Dead and Deader (2006) online. Cain looks old ... Anywho, actually pretty good.<br />
<strong>09/02/2008</strong> (T) - Movies received by Netflix and next two shipped. Re-watched my copy of Spirited Away (2001).<br />
<strong>09/03/2008</strong> (W) - Received next two movies from Netflix.<br />
<strong>09/04/2008</strong> (R) - Watched Bulletproof Monk (2003). I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>09/05/2008</strong> (F) - Watched The Shop on Main Street (1965), which was rather depressing and slow. I&#39;m going to drop it off today (actually I let the post woman pick it up). Watched my new copy of Paprika (2007). Definitely seems to require another watch.<br />
<strong>09/08/2008</strong> (M) - Both movies received by Netflix and next two shipped.<br />
<strong>09/09/2008</strong> (T) - Received next two movies. Watched The Iron Giant (1999), which I&#39;ll drop off tomorrow. Watched Godzilla 2000 (1999) courtesy of Dan Conderman.<br />
<strong>09/10/2008</strong> (W) - Watched Fantastic Four (2005), which I&#39;ll drop off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>09/11/2008</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>09/12/2008</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Received and watched City Lights (1931), which was both rather funny, and sad. Definitely worth watching. I&#39;ll drop it off tonight or tomorrow, to Milwaukee (it&#39;s the mailer it came in).<br />
<strong>09/13/2008</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched My Neighbor Totoro (1988) - another great movie by Hayao Miyazaki. I&#39;ll drop it off tonight, tomorrow, or Monday morning. (Dropped it off that night.)<br />
<strong>09/14/2008</strong> (Su) - Watched Caddyshack (1980) at my sister&#39;s.<br />
<strong>09/15/2008</strong> (M) - Movies received by Netflix and next ones shipped.<br />
<strong>09/16/2008</strong> (T) - Received next movies. Didn&#39;t get home &#39;til late, so missed House and watching either movie.<br />
<strong>09/17/2008</strong> (W) - Watched The Pink Panther (1963). Good moments, but unfortunate ending ... I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>09/18/2008</strong> (R) - Watched 13 Ghosts (2001), which was actually rather good. I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow. Using an old Milwaukee mailer, since they won&#39;t get it until Saturday anyways, I think, and they won&#39;t be open.<br />
<strong>09/19/2008</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Watched my copy of Strange Days (1995) again.<br />
<strong>09/20/2008</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Blue (1993), which was slow, but good. I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow or Monday morning (won&#39;t matter either way).<br />
<strong>09/22/2008</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Watched Young Frankenstein (1974) online. Got long.<br />
<strong>09/23/2008</strong> (T) - Was supposed to have next movie, but I don&#39;t. Watched Casino Royale (1967) online. Movie received by Netflix, and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>09/24/2008</strong> (W) - Received next two movies. Watched Timecop (1994), which was actually pretty darn good for how it worked out. I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow. Watched They Live (1988), another great film by a master.
