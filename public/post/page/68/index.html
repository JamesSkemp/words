                                The following is a review of the Kindle version of Brian Ruh&rsquo;s Stray Dog of Anime: The Films of Mamoru Oshii (Second Edition). An interesting look at Mamoru Oshii&rsquo;s works Like many others, my first introduction to Mamoru Oshii was via the first Ghost in the Shell movie. At the time I was looking for something like the Matrix, and the Internet of the time highly recommended looking at Ghost in the Shell.

Not as good a fit, but still nigh perfect Right around Christmas I was out shopping around for a replacement to my second generation Nexus 7, due to speed and battery issues. Within a couple days I had picked up one of the 2015 models of the Amazon Fire 7.

A weird hybrid First I&rsquo;ve got to say I&rsquo;m not sure how to review the Alienware Steam Machine ASM100-4980BLK. Do I compare it to the consoles, as that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re trying to make (especially with SteamOS being the OS on this machine)?

Actually on par with the official type cover When I purchased my Surface Pro 4 a number of months ago I opted to spend the extra money to get the official type cover with it. Having used a couple other two-in-one machines, getting used to the keys wasn&rsquo;t too hard.

High build quality, and terrific sound Probably a decade ago I had a coworker who lent me a pair of her Sennheiser headphones for a couple hours one day. I was looking at picking up some nicer headphones, and she thought that listening to her&rsquo;s might sway me, I think.

                                The following is a review of the Fury of Dracula Third Edition Board Game, which I received as part of the Amazon Vine program. So many pieces, but easy after a week I haven't played any of the previous editions of Fury of Dracula, so I can't speak to the changes made in this third edition. However, as I understand it, the game has changed for the better. This supports 2 to 5 players, with one player controlling Dracula and the others controlling one or more of the hunters.

                                The following is how I configured a Raspberry Pi 2 as a samba server, using a Seagate Backup Plus Slim, 1TB, drive. For ease I purchased the CanaKit Raspberry Pi 2 Complete Starter Kit. It runs about $70 and includes enough to get up and running with the Raspberry Pi 2, with the Pi itself, a nice case, power supply, HDMI cable, WiFi adapter, and SD card with NOOBS/Raspbian installer. For the hard drive I opted to purchase a Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1TB Portable External Hard Drive, since I've had good enough luck with Seagate in the past, and reviews are generally favorable.

What worked for me was grabbing the mega.nz zip download and then: Make sure you're a developer and you allow apps from unknown sources. Install ES File Explorer via the Amazon Appstore. It's something I install on all my Android devices. Extract the contents of the zip you downloaded from Mega somewhere.

                                The following is a review of the Adonit Jot Dash - Fine Point Precision Stylus, received as part of the Amazon Vine program. Not what I was expecting For the most part I'm not yet at the point in my life where I need to use a stylus pen for my electronic devices. My fingers are the right size, and with devices getting larger, I don't need the precision. I'm also not much of an artist, so it's not necessary to draw.

Spoiler: I really like them. Finally, something that works with my beard Right away I'll say that I haven't used these to clip the hair on the top of my head. I have some barbershop-quality clippers from Wahl that I use for that, and I've had no reason to try anything else.

A sort of board game Resistance Reading through the rules for the first time I kept thinking about the game The Resistance (although there are many games like this). In The Resistance every character is either part of the resistance, or part of a group trying to sabotage them. As the game progresses you start to figure out who's who, in an attempt to score a win for your team.

A good way to get into the genre (I played the Steam version of this game, and this review is based upon that.) This was the first real hidden object game I played, thanks to a kind Reddit user who gifted me a key. It was actually quite good, with great artwork.

Unfortunately the complexities of the game currently result in this partial review. This review will be updated in the coming days and weeks as we further play the game.

Fun, but I don't think it'll turn into a staple (Normally I'd work this into my review, but it's a little harder this time. As noted above this is a review of a product I received for free, through Amazon. I try very hard to not let that impact my rating.) Lauge Luchau, the creator of Dimension, was once an architect.

                                The following is a review of Batman Fluxx, received as part of the Amazon Vine program. Not just a minor tweak of Fluxx Ever since I was introduced to Fluxx well over a year ago (I think it was Oz Fluxx) I've been interested in the game. Thus far I've played Oz Fluxx, Zombie Fluxx, Pirate Fluxx, and Cthulhu Fluxx, having purchased the latter in July 2014. When I saw that a copy of Batman Fluxx was up for review I wondered how the game would play compared to the others, and requested a copy.

Can't replace the clam shell models A couple years after college I started hearing about George Foreman's lean, mean, cooking machines. Since I was living alone at the time, and wasn't much of a cook, I decided to try one of the early models, with the plates that could not be removed.

                                I recently decided to upgrade my ASUS X200M, after successfully upgrading my mom's. Unfortunately, after upgrading my machine I ran into an issue where the touchpad was completely unresponsive, and I was forced to either use the touchscreen or a USB mouse. After a bit of looking around I found a post on CNET's forums that detailed a way to fix unresponsive touchpads in Windows 10. While the original question was about an Asus Transformer T100, this also worked for the X200M.

Sounds great to me First, I feel as though any review about audio equipment requires a disclaimer if you're not an audiophile. So, "I'm not an audiophile." That said, after almost a month of using the Sony SRSX55 I can honestly say that it sounds great to me. Thus far I've used the device for playback of music over Bluetooth from an Android device, as well as audio from an Xbox One (plugged via HDMI to a monitor, which output over the speaker connection).

                                The following is a review of the BLU Studio C 5.0-Inch Android Smartphone, received as part of the Amazon Vine program. Very decent entry-level phone First off, as I appear to be unable to use my existing SIM card from my provider with this phone I was unable to use it to make standard calls. However, I did use it for playing music, browsing the web, and Google Hangouts. That said, I was pretty impressed with the BLU Studio C immediately after opening the package as it included both a screen protector as well as clear back case cover.

                                The following is a review of Bang Gang's 2015 album The Wolves Are Whispering. Another beautiful album Warning: I find music to be very subjective and find it hard to explain why it is that I might like a song in words and without being able to sit someone down and let them listen with me. So the number of music reviews I do is very low. However, this album has been out for three days and has no reviews on Amazon.

Error 0110 When I was building my gaming PC I picked up a Blu-ray drive after a few weeks, to compliment the DVD player, and so I wouldn't need to power on my PlayStation 3 to watch certain movies. However, despite hearing good things about the free options I found the setup to be too large of a pain.

Massive If there's only one thing I could say about the Chill Bag I would simply say that it's massive. While the product name makes note of bean bags, the Chill Bag is instead filled with over 35 pounds of multi-colored pieces of foam, spread out over around 5 square feet, once fully expanded.

A great basic switch It has been many years since I've used a network switch, as wireless has become fast and prevalent enough that most devices are just wireless now. However, since I'm running into an issue where wired computers weren't on the same subnet due to the usage of a router.

Just Delicious Having played the game with three different groups, consisting of 2, 4, and 5 people, I can honestly say that every group I've played it with has had a great time. I won't go into the actual rules, other than to say that they're relatively simple to learn and pick up.

On par with a wired connection, but mind the size I've used one other TP-LINK product, an AC1200 USB adapter, which I generally found to be acceptable. So when I saw this I thought about another machine I could switched from a networked connection to a wireless one.

                                The following is a review of Mars Attacks: The Dice Game, received as part of the Amazon Vine program. Fun, but the theme may be an acquired taste Being a fan of the Mars Attacks movie, I was interested in just how well a dice game based upon it would be. The game actually puts you into the role of the Martians, and does not really tie into the movie. This is quite honestly a wise decision on their part, since personally I like playing the bad guys sometimes.

Simple enough for kids, but fun for all A number of years ago I was introduced to the SET Card Game by a former co-worker. SET is fairly basic game that requires a deal of thinking, and is something I really enjoyed playing. So when I saw the SET name on the box for the Karma Card Game I knew I had to request a copy.

A pleasant twist on the SET card game I was introduced to the SET card game a little over four years ago by a former co-worker. Having more experience than I, she kicked my butt every time we played together, but it was enjoyable, and I still did sufficiently good at the single player variant.

This assumes that you have already created a new libGDX project and have already imported it into Android Studio. If you have not, please review Creating your first libgdx project with Android Studio 1.1.0. With the project imported, select the configurations drop-down, or navigate to Run Edit Configurations...` in the menu.

The product I received was free as part of the Amazon Vine program. Very nice, but may not be required For context, I have two rather old HP monitors, from 2007, which up until early last year I was using for my PC monitors.

                                The following is a review of LibGDX Game Development Essentials, written by Juwal Bose, and released in December 2014 by Packt Publishing. Difficult to follow, but not a complete waste of time LibGDX Game Development Essentials is hard to follow along with, and since I'm one of those learners who likes to follow along when I'm learning a technology, that made this book troublesome. On the one hand, I certainly got something out of the book, and successfully got a glimpse of just how powerful LibGDX is.

                                This is a quick 'tutorial' on how to get started with libGDX with Android Studio 1.1.0. Unfortunately while libGDX can be used with Android Studio 1.x, documentation regarding it is sparse. I'll assume that you have Android Studio 1.1.0 (1.x generally) installed and properly running. If you haven't already, download libgdx from the official site. The file name should be gdx-setup.jar, and will be run whenever you need to create a new project.

Enjoyable even for solo play Thus far I've only been able to play solo games of Munchkin Panic, so this review will be based upon that fact. I've never played Castle Panic, which this game is a variant of, but I'm familiar with Munchkin. So I wasn't quite sure what to expect of this game when I got it.

I somehow made it through the first two levels, and recently opted to run it for a little over an hour today to just get the trading cards (which are worth next to nothing in money and gems). I'm thankful I only paid 17 cents for this, thanks to a bundle.

Makes pushups easy I don't find pushups all that difficult, outside of the fact that I just don't know what to do with my hands. Since my apartment is carpeted, putting my hands into fists results in carpet marks on my ends, and some irritation. As a developer, who works on a computer most of the day, stretching my fingers out causes me some concern as I'm wary of wrist issues.

                                As of this post, Lenovo does not have an ADB Interface Driver for their Lenovo A7600-F TAB A10. However, since I'd like to develop on it, I had to find a solution. An initial forum post pointed me to the older ADB Interface Driver for their ThinkPad Tablet. However, trying to update the android_winusb.inf with the necessary information was throwing a signature error when I tried to install it on Windows 8.1.

                                The following is a review of Cash N Guns Second Edition, received as part of the Amazon Vine program. Fun with a good group When initially reading over the instructions for Cash N Guns I wasn't sure how it would actually play. The idea of robbers trying to split the loot from a heist is pretty easy to understand, but would it play out fairly? Having now played the game in a group of five I think it went fairly well.

                                The following is a review of Gray Matter (2010), available for the PC on Steam and on Amazon.com. An enjoyable story, with minor puzzles I find point and click adventures to be generally enjoyable, but the older I get the more interest I have in the story they tell than the puzzles. So when I finally started playing Gray Matter, which I received for very cheap as part of a bundle, my main focus was on the story.

Call me an impressed Mega Bloks first-timer I'll be honest; I'm a LEGO guy. My sister and I grew up with LEGO, and I have fond memory of them. We did have some Tyco blocks, but we were primarily LEGO. I'm not a fan of Call of Duty, but the set looked pretty interesting, and had a 'less than LEGO' price, I figured it would be worth a try.

So much information Many many years ago I did quite a bit with POV-Ray and Rhino3D, but as I got older focused more and more on the web. While I'd heard of Blender many times in the past, I had also heard that the GUI wasn't exactly friendly for new users.

                                The following is a review of Devil Kings, released in 2005 for the PlayStation 2. Perfectly acceptable example of the genre There's something satisfying about games of this particular genre. You play a kind of super-powered individual, able to wade your way through groups of the enemies armies, fighting your way to their lord(s), and taking them down. It can certainly be repetitive, yet despite that ... the simple controls, basic story lines, multiple characters, and excited announcer, drives you play each character, and at increasing levels of difficulty.

Runs hot, but nice interface and speeds I have a couple routers around the house, but I've always been a fan of Linksys, so when I saw the opportunity to review the Linksys AC1200+ I snapped it up. Unfortunately, while it has a number of good points, I'll ultimately be unplugging it and using an existing device instead.

Enjoyable story and gameplay After having the game for a little over 9 months, I've finally beaten the main campaign, Dead Man's Switch, of Shadowrun Returns (2013). It didn't take this long to beat it because the game wasn't enjoyable, but rather because the machine I had until a few months ago wasn't ideal for gaming, so it wasn't until the last three months that I really got into this.

Great story, interesting puzzles Having liked Syberia (you have to like a game if you've bought multiple copies over the years), when I saw the Still Life trilogy in a bundle (Post Mortem, Still Life, Still Life 2) a few months ago I decided to pick it up. While it's taken me a while to get to this game (not thinking, I played the second in the series first), I'm glad I finally did.

                                The following is a review of Fearless Fantasy (2014), available for PC on Steam. Enjoyable, but controls are a bit iffy While Fearless Fantasy isn't long (there's only 13 sections), it's nonetheless an interesting game. The combat mechanic is probably more suited for touch-based devices (I found windowed mode makes the game a little easier, than playing full screen in 1920x1080), it still keeps combat interesting. Because of the mechanic, I did find myself having to grind earlier levels for experience, and ended the game with level 17 characters.

Good story, but iffy controls From the reviews of this game I was expecting a short game with a good story. And having now beat the game in a little over 3 and a half hours (having only looked up if I needed to get off the horse to exit the stage; we'll get to that in a bit), that's exactly what I got.

                                The following is a review of Hexcells Plus (2014), played on the PC. More of the same, with a bit more complexity Having gone through the first Hexcells rather quickly, I just as quickly started playing the standalone Hexcells Plus. While this game contains the same number of puzzles as the original, it adds additional gameplay dynamics. While I finished the first in less than 2 hours, Steam reports that I put in 8 hours on this version.

Works perfectly to convert a wired connection, with no loss of speed The NETGEAR Trek N300 Range Extender and Travel Router (PR2000) can assist as either a simple wifi router for a normally wired home network, as a wireless range extender, as a protected wireless hotspot on the go, or to convert a wired device to a wireless one.

                                The following is a review of Hexcells (2014), played on the PC. A short, but enjoyable, puzzle game Ultimately, I recommend Hexcells, especially for the price I paid ($1.25 with the standalone expansion), as I got a around 110 minutes of play. It's a pretty basic puzzle game, with some extra dynamics added in as you progress. I do wish that the puzzles were a little more complex, but I also tend to enjoy this type of game, so the general idea wasn't new to me.

Fantastic music and interesting branching story When I ordered Radiant Historia back in February 2013 I'll readily admit that I played for only a few hours before I let it, and my 3DS, sit and gather dust. At the time the cheapest new copy of the game I could get was $70, so I was expecting much more from the game.

                                The following is a review of The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing (2013), played on the PC. An enjoyable hack and slash dungeon crawler Having recently built a gaming PC I had to think hard about what game(s) I would initially pick up. Since Diablo II was such an enjoyable game, and one of my most memorable experiences when I was PC gaming, I initially looked at Diablo III. However, the current state of the game, and knowing that eventually the DLC and base game would be selling for half the price, led me to look elsewhere.

Excellent primer for your average user In the past I've used Adobe Photoshop for my own personal use, as well as at work for relatively simple work. However, after losing my discount a number of years ago, I've kept my eye open for good alternatives, especially for those that were asking for my recommendation on software.

                                The following is a review of Ghost Trick, released in 2011, for the Nintendo DS. What a very good game A very short while ago I watched a video that featured Ghost Trick briefly, and I fell in love with the graphic style of the game. After ordering it with some other DS games, for use on my 3DS XL, I decided that it would be the first of the batch that I would play, and therefore also one of the first games I had played on the system in months.

No suction due to cold, but great grip Right away let me say that I wanted to like this product. Unfortunately, a lack of suction made it impossible for me to fully test this in my car. However, given the weather in Wisconsin, I fully attribute that to the extremely cold weather.

                                This is sad, and something that I had to write. You can probably skip it. Around 2 a.m. this morning I put my cat down. I'm glad I never changed her name when I got her as it let me give her the nickname of 'pretty girl Pearl,' and I always smiled a little when I said it ("I'm a poet and I didn't even know it"). It was peaceful, and I hope that one day, when I get sick and/or just plain old, that I'll be able to go as peacefully.

External speaker is key I've tried two different microphones before this headset: the one that came with Warhawk and the PlayStation 3 camera, and since I rarely play multiplayer games, and PlayStation players are less likely to have microphones that Xbox 360 players, both were just fine.

Perfect with my Nexus 7 I currently have a Nexus 7 with a case that allows a certain level of tilting. However, since the case is relatively soft, it doesn't work as well as I'd like. I was also looking at purchasing a larger tablet over the holiday season, so when I saw this up for review I jumped at the opportunity.

                                The following is a review of Contrast, released in 2013, for the PlayStation 4. Charming Since Watch Dogs was delayed, I've been thinking about what game would be my first PlayStation 4 experience. Between Contrast, Flower, and Resogun, I ultimately decided upon Contrast, since while I had played flOw first on my PlayStation 3, I had already played (and enjoyed) Flower on the PS3, and wanted something slightly different. Contrast is free for PlayStation Plus subscribers, of which I am one of.

                                For both machines I'm doing this on (running Windows 7 and Windows 8) I had already installed Github for Windows. However, since I've been converted to posh-git, I wanted to do an install that would get me away from continuing to use it. The below is roughly what I did, and may not be completely correct. Install the latest version of msysgit (currently 1.8.4). Set execution policy (run as administrator).Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned Install posh-git(new-object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("http://psget.net/GetPsGet.ps1") | iex Possibly open the Powershell profile and add the Git path when Powershell runs.

                                On July 13, 2007 I converted my blog over from WordPress to BlogEngine.NET (having previously used custom code written in PHP). It was a great switch, as I was beginning to really dig into .NET, and I've found there's no better way to learn something than actually doing something with it. While I don't think I did much with the beta, I was in on 1.0 and was fairly active at first.

A dark masterpiece I picked up a new copy of Alice: Madness Returns for the Xbox 360 back in April of 2012. Since it came with a copy of the original American Mcgee&rsquo;s Alice, I decided to start with that in May. However, it took me until November of that year to beat that game (it was good, just long), and then I didn&rsquo;t start the main game until the middle of August.

                                Last month I was playing Disgaea 3: Absence of Detention on the PlayStation Vita. I had finished the game, but had started a new game and was picking up the Diez Gentleman by losing to Raspberyl. Unfortunately, when I lost to her I kept getting the error code of C2-12828-1, and the game crashed. In my particular case I just didn't have enough room in homeroom. Unfortunately I forget the exact number, but the game wants you to keep more slots open than you need.

Very nice, save the short power cord While I just replaced my router with a MediaLink router (since I wanted wireless N), when Amazon Vine offered this D-Link router I figured I would give it a try, since I had noticed issues with my laptop losing wireless and my tablet experiencing extreme drops.

So when I was asked if I wanted a review copy of Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 Quickstart Cookbook I went ahead and took the opportunity to do so, to see what I could look forward to.

                                This morning I created two API wrappers for the Mashape implementations of XboxApi.com and XboxLeaders.com. These unofficial APIs allow you to pull information from Xbox Live for particular users. I've used a simiilar structure for both (based upon XboxLeaders.com's PHP wrapper, since I thought I was working against there API when I was in fact working against XboxApi.com's ...), and both are available on Github. XboxLeadersWrapper XboxApiWrapper In order to use these APIs you'll need to have an account on Mashape, subscribe, and generate keys.

A quick introduction to .NET extension methods In the 5+ years that I&rsquo;ve been doing .NET I&rsquo;ve been created my own extension methods twice. I was already aware that LINQ was built on extension methods, but I very rarely found myself needing to extend something that I didn&rsquo;t already have the code for.

Actually, I did buy the Lara Croft PSN/Xbox Live game, but that&rsquo;s not really a Tomb Raider game in the classic sense. I also received a free copy of Tomb Raider: Underworld via PlayStation Plus, but I&rsquo;ve yet to finish it, and don&rsquo;t have much drive to. However, Tomb Raider is not only the first Lara Croft game I&rsquo;ve paid full price for, but one of a very few games I&rsquo;ve picked up almost immediately after it was released.

                                The following is a review of Spec Ops: The Line (2012). A squad-based shooter with an excellent story I really bought the SOCOM 4 Full Deployment Edition because at the time it was the cheapest way to quick up everything to get started with PlayStation Move. And in fact I only played it for a short time before I moved on to other games. I&rsquo;ve since tried to get back into it, but since I had issues getting the game running again (odd patch issues), I haven&rsquo;t done so.

                                I've been using GitHub for a little more than a month now, and it's been about 2 weeks since I shut down the machine running my local Subversion instance. GitHub for Windows needs some work, but given that Phil Haack is/was working on the Windows aspect, I feel pretty confident that it'll continue to get better. Moving to a system that allows for public repositories also allowed me to publish some really old code, that might be of benefit to someone.

                                With the news that Visual Studio 2012 will support Git out-of-the-box, and me deciding to stop storing my repositories locally, I decided to switch to Git this weekend. They say the best way to do this is via svn2git, which unfortunately uses Ruby. Since I'm on Windows, and haven't done Ruby development, I needed to download Ruby using RubyInstaller for Windows. Next I needed to have RubyGems support, which meant downloading from RubyForge.

                                Yesterday morning I committed version 1.2 of My Video Game Tracker to a public repository on GitHub. At this time I intend on letting my publishing license lapse on Windows Phone development (which is still a number of months away), and have decided that I probably won't do anything further targeting Windows Phone 7. In the coming weeks I'll probably also post the Madison Metro application that I was working on, warts and all.

                                The following is a review of a 72 Pin Connector for NES 8 BIT Nintendo System (Bulk Packaging), by Classic Game Source. Our Nintendo was purchased new (as far as I know), way back when they were still being sold in stores. However, we haven&rsquo;t played it all that much, since, like many others, the console would blink instead of playing the game. Last weekend I visited my sister, who has it now, and I couldn&rsquo;t get it come on at all.

                                The following if a review of Milwaukee Mafia (2012), written by Gavin Schmitt. Is a picture worth a thousand words? First, I should note that I&rsquo;ve known the author for around a decade, so my review have some level of bias. Second, having followed the project, and been part of the Kickstarter effort, my experience with the book has been fairly long and diverse. While I was initially expecting a typical, written, book, Milwaukee Mafia, as the fact that it&rsquo;s part of the &lsquo;Images of America&rsquo; series, consists mostly of photos, all with captions, and short introductions beginning each of the six chapters.

AmazonBasics: When price and quality matters While a number of retailers will try to sell you expensive cables, I&rsquo;ve personally found Amazon&rsquo;s AmazonBasics line to be exactly what&rsquo;s needed, at an even better than expected price. This isn&rsquo;t the first HDMI cable I&rsquo;ve received in the AmazonBasics line, but I don&rsquo;t believe my previous cable supported &lsquo;ethernet, 3D, and audio return&rsquo; like this one promises.

A well made cover; one happy purchaser Seeing as how my Nexus 7 has officially converted me to Android tablets (although we&rsquo;ll see what Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface devices are priced at), I figured it was time to finally write a review for the item that&rsquo;s been keeping my iPad safe for almost a year and a half. When I picked up my first-generation iPad I obviously needed something to carry it around in.

I&rsquo;ll admit it, as I guy who likes girls sex can get me to purchase something, and Onechanbara certainly promises that.

                                Today I decided to finally make progress on a couple pending applications. As part of that process I needed to upgrade one of my sites to .NET 4. Unfortunately it has a child application that needs to say as .NET 2.0/3.5. After approximately 30 minutes of downtime, I finally got things configured correctly (seemingly). Here's what I ended up having to do. This assumes IIS 7.5. Wrap the system.web and system.webServer elements in the parent Web.config with the following: &lt;location path="."

                                The following is a review of Ninja Blade (2009), for the Xbox 360. A lot of quick time events, but an overlooked gem God of War was a pretty good game, but the game made popular quick time events, which I absolutely despised. When I saw Ninja Blade at a used media store I was taken back by how little it cost, for what seemed like a fairly enjoyable game, similar to Ninja Gaiden (note: Ninja Gaiden 2 for the Xbox 360 is kicking my butt, but I fully plan on finishing it, have picked up Sigma for the PlayStation 3, and am semi-interested in picking up others in the series).

                                As I develop my first Windows Phone 7 application, My Video Game Tracker, I want to make sure that the many games I've added won't accidentally be lost (as I'm deploying test versions to my physical phone). The below assumes you're using Windows PowerShell, but they should run on the standard command line. Taking screenshots of the application's data When you install the Windows Phone SDK the Isolated Storage Explorer Tool is also installed.

                                The following is a review of Yakuza Dead Souls (2012), released for the PlayStation 3. Inconsistent targeting is easily overlooked in this gem When I first heard about Yakuza Dead Souls I was a little worried. The best part about the Yakuza series is the story, and I feared that they were jumping on the zombie bandwagon (albeit late). However, I should have reminded myself about the multitude of games I have that has the Sega logo on the box, as there was nothing to fear with this iteration in the Yakuza series.

                                I love Netflix, but there's no easy way to get a listing of the movies I've rated through the service. To ease with that, I've finally started on a script that will clean the Netflix output, so it's a bit easier to parse. Fire up Chrome, visit either&nbsp;https://www2.netflix.com/RentalActivity?all=true or&nbsp;https://account.netflix.com/WiViewingActivity?all=true, open a console, and use the following two scripts: Script 1: Load jQuery var GM_JQ = document.createElement('script'); GM_JQ.src = 'https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js'; GM_JQ.type = 'text/javascript'; document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(GM_JQ); Script 2: Remove rating graphics $('.stbrIl').hide(); $('.stbrMaskFg').css('background-image', 'none').css('text-indent', '0').css('width', '200px').css('vertical-aign', 'middle'); $('.stbrMaskBg').css('background-image', 'none'); There's still work to be done, but it's a sufficient start.

MindJack got a lot of grief when it came out, and it hasn&rsquo;t gotten much better. However, seeing it for under $5 one day, I decided to pick up a copy and see just how bad it really is. MindJack tells the story of a man who&rsquo;s name I can&rsquo;t remember (and that I don&rsquo;t care enough to look up) as he tries to discover what he can, as within the first few minutes of the game he&rsquo;s treated as something of a traitor.

A wonderful short story When Enslaved: Odyssey to the West was first being discussed I was keeping my eye on it, as I had picked up Heavenly Sword when I picked up my PlayStation 3 and thorougly enjoyed it.&nbsp;However, after lackluster reviews I opted to wait until I picked it up.&nbsp;Unfortunately, it took this long to finally do so.

While I had heard of Julie Lerman and her book Programming Entity Framework, after the release of code first I was on the fence on just how much I would get out of the existing book. With the release of&nbsp;Programming Entity Framework: Code First&nbsp;I knew I&rsquo;d learn something, so I picked up an electronic copy (PDF) and started digging in.

Over the top antics delivers just what I needed After the bombardment of commercials online for this game, I had it on my list to pick up after the price dropped into the $20 range. However, since PlayStation 3 users can get a free copy of Saints Row 2 by picking it up before January or February of next year, and the price at retailers had dropped to $40, I decided to pick up a copy early.

Amazing value, for a great RPG A while ago a friend lent me his copy of Dragon Age Origins for the Xbox 360. While I enjoyed the game, I had a number of other games that I was playing, and I returned it without finishing it. With the price drops of the Ultimate Edition, I decided to finally pick up a copy, for the PS3, but it sat unused until a short time ago.

                                Since it doesn't seem CollabNet is really going to keep their non-Edge Subversion application, I've decided to migrate to VisualSVN Server. Roughly, here are the steps I went through to migrate, which also includes a 1.6.x upgrade. VisualSVN migration Installed VisualSVN. Repositories saved to C:\Repositories Setup existing users. Import existing repositories. Should already be upgraded, but upgrade to 1.5, just in case. Upgrade TortoiseSVN. Upgrade working copies to 1.7.

                                The following is a review of The 3rd Birthday for the PlayStation Portable. Fairly incomprehensible story, but wonderful game play Way back in 2005 I found a copy of Parasite Eve. While I tried playing through the game shortly after, it wasn&rsquo;t until many years later that I actually started and finished the game (twice). I also happened to come upon a copy of Parasite Eve 2, but outside of a very little bit of play (less than an hour), I never really got into the game.

                                Going through the game Nier yet again, I wanted an easier way to track what weapon levels I had already upgraded to, and what items I still needed to unlock weapon items. Phase one towards that goal is creating an XML file with weapon upgrade information which is available online: Nier weapon data. An XML schema document for this information is also available: Nier weapon XSD. Sample LINQ query The following query can be run from LINQPAD, and will either display all items with their counts, or a grouped listing of items with the total quantity needed.

                                The following is a review of Yakuza 4 for the PlayStation 3. A masterpiece I picked up Yakuza 4 without having played any of the previous iterations of the game. After looking at reviews online I thought it might have a pretty good story, and provide a good amount of entertainment. After playing a little under an hour of the game I was quite impressed what I had seen. Used copies of Yakuza 3 were available locally, at a pretty decent price, so I decided to pick up a copy of Yakuza 3 and play that first (since Yakuza 1 and 2 were a little harder to find, and more importantly on the PlayStation 2).

                                The following is a review of Last Rebellion for the PlayStation 3. It&rsquo;s interesting how badly this game is generally rated, yet I didn&rsquo;t find the approximately 12 hours I put into the game all that horrible. Sure the graphics don&rsquo;t push the limits of the PlayStation 3, and the game could certainly have been released for the PlayStation 2, but given the current pricing of the game I&rsquo;d argue it&rsquo;s worth a purchase.

                                The following is a review of Yakuza 3, for the PlayStation 3. Around the time Yakuza 4 was being released I began hearing about the game, although after further research I do remember hearing about those who had asked actual Yakuza to play a Yakuza game (the 3rd specifically). Either way, everything I had heard about 4 suggested I would like it, especially when I heard it had a great story.

Having used ASP.NET MVC since around the time 1.0 was released I was a little interested in what Professional ASP.NET MVC 3 would bring to someone like myself. Would this book provide enough new content to someone like me who&rsquo;s tried to keep up on the framework? So when I was contacted by someone at Wiley to receive a copy for review I was of course interested.

                                The following is a review of Eat Them!, for the PlayStation 3, and released on the PlayStation Network. I just recently picked up a copy of Eat Them!, for the PlayStation 3, as it was on sale for PlayStation Plus members. According to some Eat Them! is a Rampage-like game, where you control a monster that lays waste to an area of a city. Indeed, this an extremely apt description, as playing this game brought to my mind fond memories of putting quarters/tokens into the Rampage machine, and later playing it, and later releases (such as for the Nintendo 64) to mind.

                                When I moved from my custom system to WordPress to BlogEngine.NET I never did end up copying over all the old comments on my posts. Heck, I don't even think I moved over all my posts. But since I'm sticking with DISQUS I decided to move all my BE.NET comments over to DISQUS, and over the last few hours have been making the necessary changes and performing the necessary cleanup.&nbsp; I found a great extension that generated the XML for me (thankfully), but since I'm me I'm actually going through and removing the extra comments, so my data source is clean.

It is what it is, and that&rsquo;s just fine Years ago I was hooked by the uniqueness of the first few levels of Drakengard, released for the PlayStation 2. When I finally found and picked up a copy I found it had hooked its claws into me even more.&nbsp;So when Drakengard 2 came out I of course picked up a copy.

                                The following is a review of jQuery Mobile, written by Jon Reid. A great introduction to jQuery Mobile development While jQuery Mobile has not yet had a final release, a number of alphas, and most recently a beta, have been released. When a new technology or framework is released it&rsquo;s sometimes difficult to determine when the best time is to start learning about it. Generally I try to stay away until a final version is released, but since this project is tied to jQuery, I can only assume that good things will come from this framework.

                                I picked up an electronic copy of jQuery Mobile by Jon Reid a little while ago and have been slowly making my way through it. I've finally gotten to the point where I wanted to try creating a jQuery Mobile version of my video game listing. View the jQuery Mobile version of my video games listing. In addition to jQuery Mobile, this also uses oXygen XML Editor, for taking the original XML source and transforming it via an XSLT 2.0 solution to generate the HTML.

                                I've had Final Fantasy VIII for many years, but have never finished it. In fact, I've never gotten through the first disc. However, having recently started it up once again, after picking up an electronic copy on the PSN (I still have the original, but this is the only legit way to play it on my PSP), I have to say that Final Fantasy VIII contains my favorite mini-game of the series, and perhaps one of my top favorites of all.

                                Released earlier today, Internet Explorer 10: Platform Preview 2 is now available for download. Just the other day at work I had fired up IE10PP1 to see if a new version was available, so I'll just go ahead and assume Microsoft was zeroing in on my brainwaves with this. I definitely like the direction they've gone with these platform previews, so I hope to see that continue. And that's about all I have to say about that.

                                When Jeff Atwood announced the release of the&nbsp;mvc-mini-profiler for ASP.NET MVC Web sites I was intrigued. Just the other day he wrote an article Performance is a Feature and I decided I could hold off no longer. Tonight (for better or worse) I finally got this up and running on one of my sites, and fully intend on adding it to at least one more. To install it I naturally used NuGet, but note that it's called MiniProfiler there.

                                Over the past few months a number of sites have switched over to Facebook-powered comments. For the most part those sites are ones that I've never commented one, nor will comment on. However, I recently discovered that a former co-worker, Rob Lumley, switched his site over to Facebook, and recently wrote an article about it titled Add Facebook Comments to WordPress. Since I don't use Facebook comments, I figured I'd post the response I had written and tried to post anonymously, here instead.

Enjoyable, but quick, with some annoying platforming As I continue playing games that received less than critical acclaim, I found myself playing Dante&rsquo;s Inferno for the Xbox 360. Dante&rsquo;s Inferno tells the story of Dante who journeys through Hell to save his beloved Beatrice. As we progress through the story we learn more about Dante himself, and why it is that he doesn&rsquo;t seem so out of place in this land.

                                Somehow, while I wasn't looking, the Log Parser Plus Web site has grown to what I consider a nice size over the last handful of months. As the Log Parser Plus Web site moves towards 2000 visits a month I'll be making a number of changes in an attempt to make it even more useful. Some changes I've already made: Implemented a new design. Added login functionality. Added ELMAH support. (Administrative) My current plan with item number 2 is to potentially tie in OpenID functionality so that individuals can easily submit their own examples.

Darksiders, like Nier, the last game I played through and beat, didn&rsquo;t get all that much respect when it first came out. But Darksiders features more than just God of War meets Zelda gameplay, it tells a story worth seeing through until the end. The following review is based upon a playthrough on the Xbox 360, on the hardest -&nbsp;Apocalyptic - difficulty.

However, if you&rsquo;re just starting out and will be using one of the various libraries (like jQuery), this book may not (yet) be for you.

                                My Web site on Microsoft Log Parser gets a fair amount of monthly traffic, but I've never really been happy with the design, which has been in place since I created the site back in September of 2008. While I was fully intending on updating the site last week (as well as doing a slew of other productive things), I finally did so this morning. Design 1 Design 2 Overall, I'd say that's a positive change, for a non-designer such as myself.

                                The following is a review of Nier (2010), available on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Yes, the main character is ugly, but the story is anything but Nier, released in 2010, and developed by Cavia, gained mediocre reviews when it was released. The one thing I remember most about those reviews is the common statement that the main character in Nier was rather ugly. Of course, he (named whatever you name him) is rather ugly.

                                I've been sitting on a Linksys (Cisco) WRT54GL for a long while now. A long, long, while. Originally I was going to replace my WRT54G&nbsp;(don't get me wrong, it still works great) and install DD-WRT for the additional features. However, I just never got around to it.&nbsp;Today I finally dusted off the box (I had opened it) and started getting it setup. Interestingly, the deeper I dug into DD-WRT the more confused I became.

                                The following is a review of Ys Seven, for the Sony PlayStation Portable. Ys Seven, the first Ys game I&rsquo;ve played, was recommended to me a number of times before I finally picked up a copy. Since XSEED had some hand in the game, I was expecting a fairly good game, and found an excellent one. Ys Seven is a sort of action RPG, with combat taking place on the field, and consisting of standard attacks, dodges, skills, and special attacks.

                                The following is a review of C# in Depth, Second Edition, written by Jon Skeet. I&rsquo;ve been working in C# (heavily towards Web usage via ASP.NET) for almost a handful of years now, with the various Wrox books, and online materials, serving me rather well. However, I never really dug &lsquo;deep&rsquo; into C#, and knew that there was a great deal of functionality I just wasn&rsquo;t using. This book, C# in Depth, comes up a lot during discussions of really understanding C#, or the man (legend?) that is Jon Skeet.

                                I've never understood how conservatives can be anti-government, but also be for government intervention in regards to abortion, prostitution, gay/lesbian marriage/civil unions, video and movie ratings, marijuana, and etcetera. Of course liberals aren't necessarily pushing hard for some of these, but see a benefit to government that doesn't include making the above illegal (and enforcing those laws) and building up the miltary. Maybe it's the fact that some people are for legalizing and then taxing some of those items, and they're anti-new taxes?

                                The following is a review of The Master Switch, by Tim Wu. A long while back I had first read mention of this book on a blog I subscribed to, the author of whom writes about technology. He briefly mentioned the book before going on to some related discussion. And that&rsquo;s about all I remember. He praised the book, but I can&rsquo;t recall why. Having now finished the book, I can honestly give it some praise as well, but I fear a repeat of what&rsquo;s happened in the past.

                                While I was working on tweaking my video game listing, and creating my offline Web application manager, I kept running into issues with the cache manifest holding onto data much longer than I would have liked. After some research I found that Chrome's interface can easily be found by going to&nbsp;chrome://appcache-internals/. On Safari, on the iPod Touch and iPad, you can stop/close Safari (hold down the home button on the home screen, and close the application) and then start it back up to clear the data.

                                As previously mentioned I've been spending a good amount of time looking at HTML5/local storage in my free time. For testing purposes, I ended up putting a number of items within my video games offline application, which is fine, but results in some extraneous information on the page. To clean this up, as well as to allow for additional functionality, I've gone ahead and created a Web application manager for my media.jamesrskemp.com Web site.

                                Well done, Amazon. They've been saying for quite a while that music was heading towards the 'cloud,' and while it seemed for a while that everyone was betting on Apple doing it first, you've trumped them, with what seems like a very consumer-friendly service. 5 GB for everyone? Check. Free upgrade to 20 GB if you buy an Amazon MP3 album? Check. Amazon MP3s purchased and stored to the cloud (seemingly at purchase) don't count against your limit?

                                I've been playing around with HTML5 quite a bit recently, in particular with offline Web applications. My second experiment (my first is on pause) was with making my video games available, so that I can access the listing when I'm out shopping at used game stores. It's still in progress, but you can see my offline listing of video games now. My main intention is to make this available on my iPod Touch, so I was a bit dismayed when I found that the listing didn't display the title of the game.

                                The following is a review of Smashing CSS, written by Eric A. Meyer. Mixed signals lead to a mixed review I think this may technically be the first Eric Meyer book I&rsquo;ve ever read. I&rsquo;ve read a number of his articles online, in various forums, but just haven&rsquo;t gone out of my way to read one of his books. So I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what I was expecting, but I do know it was more then I believe I got.

                                Ever since I started my Netflix subscription in September 2006 I've been keeping track of what movies I receive and when. Unfortunately, as the years have gone by I've found it more and more difficult to easily look through the listings to see when I last watched a movie. Additionally, I've no longer been keeping track of what ratings I give movies, and why. The initial goal was really to track when Netflix shipped and received movies, as well as when I mailed and received.

I'm not exactly sure why Dan Conderman is showing this image, but since Dan Conderman likes Lady Gaga, and Dan Conderman has been known to ski in the snow ... Are the script kiddies playing a trick on Dan Conderman? Will we see sites 'hacked' with footer links to Dan Conderman's newest image search result?

                                The following is a review of the Philips DLP2277 Attachable Battery Pack and Charging Base for iPhone and iPod. When I ordered this item I was expecting only what the box suggested; a battery pack that could be connected to the iPod, which would charge the phone, and in turn be charged by the base station. Instead what I got was a box full of goodies. First you have the battery itself, which while of a fairly large size, seems to fit perfectly with the odd case I have for my iPod Touch.

                                Having recently picked up an iPod Touch, to replace my Classic, I've become very interested in HTML5's ability to navigate content offline. In my environment I decided to create a separate directory for my manifest files. I'm also running IIS 7, on Server 2008 R2, so .manifest files are already defined for WPF. So that that isn't an issue, I created a Web.config file in the manifest directory with the below contents.

                                While it seemed to be near death, if not dead, at least as far as new releases, the BlogML project is not dead, and has been undergoing a number of needed changes since the end of January. My StackOverflow question "Is the BlogML project dead, and what are some alternatives?" was answered yesterday by the project originator (one of the great things about StackOverflow, and the entire network of sites). blogml project page BlogML .NET project page BlogML discussions Being something that I've kept my eye on for a number of months, this is definitely something I'm keeping my eyes on.

When I was looking at purchasing my Sony PSP (3000), I knew I had to get some kind of case to keep it safe. After looking around, I decided upon this travel case, released by CTA. I&rsquo;ve&nbsp;create a video review of the product, which I&rsquo;ll let handle the specifics. Overall, 5 stars.

                                The following is a review of Parasite Eve, for the Sony PlayStation (1). Almost six years ago, back in 2005, I found and picked up a copy of Parasite Eve. I don&rsquo;t recall the exact circumstances on why I picked it up, but I&rsquo;m willing to bet that seeing &lsquo;Squaresoft&rsquo; on the jewel case had more than a little to do with it. With The 3rd Birthday&rsquo;s U.S. launch fast approaching, I put the first Parasite Eve back on my list, having not played it since a short time after I bought it, and even then not having finished the game.

                                The following is a review of Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep, for the Sony PlayStation Portable. Having played Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 years ago, I skipped most of the other iterations of the Kingdom Hearts series either because I didn&rsquo;t have the console (DS) or because the games just didn&rsquo;t seem to have the same appeal (Chain of Memories). Shortly before picking up my PSP I heard a lot of really great things about this game, with most reviews saying it had a good story, graphics, and an improved combat system, but a quirky camera.

                                In the past I've talked up Microsoft's Web Platform Installer. With this tool installed you can easily get an IIS server correctly setup. However, as I work my way through Pete Brown's Silverlight 4 in Action I found myself needing to install AdventureWorks (something I had looked into in the past as well). Unfortunately, Web Platform Installer installs one of the 'lower' versions of SQL Server Express, without the advanced services, which is required for AdventureWorks.

                                Former colleague Rob Lumley posted an article a few months ago about Netflix instant viewing. While responding to another comment I had an epiphany. The PSPgo was Sony's attempt to go all digital for game distribution. And it wasn't much of a success, especially since not all games are available (even recent titles, like the 'new' Kingdom Hearts). However, the iPhone, iPod Touch, and now iPad use completely digital distribution for their games, and they're doing absolutely wonderful.

                                The following code will convert an online image to a base64 string. The code was specifically written for use in LINQPad, hence the use of Dump(). String url = "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MVXV3QQ6L._SL500_SS150_.jpg"; Uri uri = new Uri(url); WebClient client = new WebClient(); byte[] imageBytes = client.DownloadData(uri); string base64String = Convert.ToBase64String(imageBytes); base64String.Dump(); base64String.Length.Dump(); ("&lt;img src='data:image/jpg;base64," + "' /&gt;").Length.Dump(); client.Dispose(); The length dumps are given to get an idea of what size would be added to a file if added inline.

                                Techmeme had a couple of interesting titles this evening. "Kinect is Selling 2X as Fast as the iPad" and "Microsoft: Over 2.5M Kinect Sold." Even if I thought I had the space for it (I'd have to move furniture every time I wanted to play it in my current apartment) I still wouldn't pick up the Kinect. Why? First there's the price. At $150 you might as well buy a PSP (which I did) or a Nintendo DSi.

                                This is a review of the Sony PlayStation Portable game Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII. Final Fantasy VII was the game that made me want a PlayStation 1. I played Final Fantasy VII briefly after it was initially released at a friend&rsquo;s house, then my own copies later in college on both the PC and PlayStation 1. So when&nbsp;I ordered a PlayStation Portable (PSP)&nbsp;recently&nbsp;it seemed like a no-brainer to pick up a copy of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII as one of my first games.

                                At the lowest level, any Sudoku puzzle consists of a number of squares. There are&nbsp;rows times columns squares consisting of a single value. There are x number of larger squares consisting of&nbsp;y&nbsp;values, where&nbsp;x is the smallest of rows&nbsp;and columns, and y is the largest of rows and columns. As already mentioned, there are a x number of rows, as well as a y number of columns. Overlap is possible, but the puzzle still consists of these basic parts.

                                On the first of the month I purchased a Sony PlayStation Portable, which was delivered to me on the 4th. Since then I've used it, mostly for play, for approximately 24 hours. Approximately 23 hours and 12 minutes of that was with my first game, Crisis Core; Final Fantasy VII, and the rest (which was probably over an hour) was initial setups, as well as the playing of a handful of demos, and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, which I had purchased for play on my PS3 a long while ago.

                                Having just received this month's issue of Game Informer I was pleasantly suprised by the article 'The 30 Characters Who Defined A Decade,' contained on pages 46 to 69. I was particularly surprised to see Elena Fisher on the list, since Nathan Drake was already present, but feel that was an excellent choice. Lost Odyssey doesn't show up as much as I feel it should, so it was great to see Kaim Argonar showing up on the list.

                                This past week I was looking at advanced statistical information about a couple Subversion repositories we use at work. While TortoiseSVN has some basic reporting, the downside is that, out of the box, users must have access to the repository to access this information. StatSVN, seemingly the most popular solution, works rather well as an alternative to granting this access. The downside (or upside, depending upon your perspective) is that viewers of the report can see what files changed, and how many lines, but not what the actual changes were (outside of the logged message).

                                I've spent a great portion of the day researching current gen portable consoles; the Nintendo DS(i) and Sony PSP. MLB for the latter was disappointing (I'm not much of a sports fan, so no surprise), but the Pokemon (I'm ashamed to admit) game was a blast. If any of the stores in Madison actually carried the Metal Gear PSP bundle I would have purchased it, even though I logically have a difficult time justifying it.

                                As&nbsp;alluded to&nbsp;in a previous post, in regards to an excellent Silverlight/WPF with MVVM tutorial, I've begun looking into the MVVM pattern, as I begin moving towards WPF and Silverlight for applications. Having fully watched the series twice, and begun a third watch working through the example, albeit with the Northwind sample database, I decided to share my labor with others. To that end I present a Subversion repository dump with a fairly step-by-step look at how to go from nothing to a simple application with WPF and Silverlight support.

Like the bar scene - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbl2LxNZ2eY - in Sin City and near the end of Avalon - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P28-PPzCI3k - and the obvious ones in the Wizard of Oz. Any other good examples? Response from Rob Lumley You seem to be mentioning when a particular color stands out.

                                I recently had the need to determine what types of music I had within my collection of music. Since I&nbsp;created iTunes Playlists to Xml so that I could export out my library on my iPod, it was easy enough to run that and then open LINQPad to run the following query. Obviously, you must export the Genre field in order for the following query to work. // Location to the XML from iTunes Playlists to XML String playlistXml = @&ldquo;C:\Users\James\Projects\services\WcfRestService\App_Data\playlistXml.xml&rdquo;; XDocument xml = XDocument.Load(playlistXml); var categories = from track in xml.Descendants(&ldquo;track&rdquo;) group track by track.Element(&ldquo;genre&rdquo;).Value into t orderby t.Key //orderby t.Count() descending select new { Category = t.Key, Count = t.Count() }; categories.Dump(); Note that you can switch the orderby lines depending upon how you want to sort the returned data.

                                Here&rsquo;s an excellent video series on Silverlight/WPF (XAML basically) and the MVVM pattern. He does, what I believe to be, an excellent job of covering XAML and MVVM during this series, and includes a bit of unit testing as well. Part one is included below, but another user on YouTube created a Playlist with the eight videos released. Update: Or you can view his blog post, time cockpit at NRWConf.

                                This afternoon I picked up a PlayStation 2 slim model from Best Buy. I've already got a fat PS2, from way back in 2004 (after a bit of research, it looks like January, and that I paid about $200 for it), that still works pretty darn good, although the controllers are a bit ... discouraging. My PlayStation 3 is also backwards compatible, so between the two I should be able to play my 52 PlayStation 2 (plus those I purchase in the future, as purchase I will)&nbsp;games for many years into the future.

                                Amazingly, although only in how fast time has gone by, my fifth year of Netflix has begun. This covers shipping with Netflix from September 26 2010 to approximately March 25 2011. See also the second half of year 4. MRNOS = Movie received and next one shipped The times 09/27/2010 (M) - MRNOS. 09/28/2010 (T) - Received and watched Iron Man 2 (2010), which I actually really liked, and am surprised I received so soon after release.

                                In a previous article, I had outlined&nbsp;classes in C# and PHP to handle&nbsp;iTunes Playlists to Xml outputs. Having let it sit on the back burner for long enough, I finally went back to the PHP class and finalized the constructor. I also added two functions for sorting. Below I have the current code for the class (a current version of the Track class for PHP will always be available elsewhere) and then an example implementation.

                                One of the things I always forget about when I'm using Microsoft Log Parser is that you can define your SQL query in a file and run it, instead of putting it in the command line. For example, the following will run whatever SQL is defined in strivinglife.robots.sql. logparser -i:w3c -o:xml file:strivinglife.robots.sql Where this comes in handy is for something like the Log Parser query I defined today, that parses IIS logs for requests to the robots.txt file and outputs the ip address and user-agent of the request, with a total count from that combination.

The one thing I definitely don&rsquo;t want in my car is gunk stuck in vents and other tiny holes. The basics of the product is that is catches all the junk on the outer layer of the &lsquo;putty.&rsquo; By rolling the product around you can move the outer layer in, giving yourself more surface to work with. Based on that, I thought I&rsquo;d try ripping the product in half, however, I was pleasantly surprised that my attempt to do so resulted in nothing.

                                The following is a review of The Grand Design, written by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow. Who&rsquo;s the audience? While interesting, the lack of a defined audience makes this book an extremely difficult read. Having read A Brief History of Time I was looking for something with a similar feel to it. Instead the book starts out geared towards anyone with the desire to really read and understand it, then seems to leave most of that audience towards the wayside - seemingly right around when the science gets a little iffy - and then finishes geared back towards the larger audience.

                                The following is a review of Odin Sphere, for the Playstation 2. I really enjoyed the ads for Muramasa: The Demon Blade, since the game looked so very beautiful, and the game looked rather enjoyable. I bought it a few days after it came out and enjoyed it immensely. After some research I found that they had previously done this game, Odin Sphere, and thought it would be worth a play.

After sitting around for a couple of months (okay, more like a handful) I finally opened them up one day and plugged them in. Surprisingly, they work pretty dang good. I&rsquo;m in no way a sound expert, but I dare say for the average (music) listener these will work perfectly fine.

                                I've recently begun reading up on PHP again. As I'm most fond of my iTunes Playlists to Xml application, I thought I'd work with that application's output - XML files with playlist data - as I continued to dig into PHP (instead of stopping now that I know enough to tweak existing code and create new functionality). Here's a basic Track object in C# and PHP. I'll of course be elaborating on these as time goes by (and already have code for the C# implementation).

I've converted it from an ODS file to XML, and am making it available. Shadow Hearts: Covenant leveling guide. Since I have a leveling guide for Shadow Hearts: From the New World&nbsp;(previously written about), it almost makes sense to go back and play the original Shadow Hearts to get information for that game as well.

                                Laying aside the question of whether these are merely in response to the amount of money being made by the Wii, and whether the technology will be as lasting as history suggests 3D televisions will be, I've been thinking about the Kinect and Move recently. Here are my thoughts. How well will they work? This is the biggest question. Ever since they were first shown on television there's been the question of what environments will support the Kinect.

                                I have a custom type that I use in a couple of my documents. Unfortunately, in the past I was adding this to each xsd, as I needed it. However, I've now figured out how to import it into xsd files as needed. Original schema Currently I'm adding the following at the top of each xsd: &lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"&gt; &lt;xs:simpleType name="customDateType"&gt; &lt;xs:restriction base="xs:string"&gt; &lt;xs:annotation&gt; &lt;xs:documentation&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Allows for a year, a year and a month, or a year, month, and day, to be defined.]]&gt;&lt;/xs:documentation&gt; &lt;/xs:annotation&gt; &lt;xs:pattern value="\d{4}(-\d{2}){0,2}"/&gt; &lt;/xs:restriction&gt; &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt; &lt;!-- Remainder of schema goes here.

                                From the archives, I've created an XML Schema and XML data file for Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams, for the Playstation 2. Currently the data only includes armor leveling information, from level 1 to 100. The data comes from an OpenDocument Spreadsheet (OnimushaDawnofDreams.ods) from way back in May of 2006. My characters and core weapons being completely maxed (not to mention souls), I may decide to replay the game to track this information as well, or just upgrade weapons.

                                As I prepare to create another XML data file, I started looking at the standards I use to create XML files, and what the recommendations are. Elements In the past I've used camel case, but on a recent file used Pascal case instead. I think this was more becauase I've started to using Pascal case for public items (variables), and camel case for private items, as that's fairly standard in development.

                                I've already installed the current verison of PHP 5.2 on my Windows Server 2008 R2 machine, but unfortunately wasn't able to get content saved via the file_put_contents function. It seems that you need to add and give IUSR the necessary permissions on the file (or directory) in order for writes to work properly.

                                Not feeling much like debugging it too much, I made a couple of modifications to my IIS installation to allow access to files contained within my user directory. Background I turned the Internet Information Services feature on on my Windows 7 Home Premium machine before using the Web Platform Installer to add additional functionality. However, I kept running into a permissions issue, as the sites I setup were located in my Users directory (C:\Users\James).

                                This is a review of AmazonBasics USB 2.0 A-Male to Mini-B Cable (6 Feet / 1.8 Meters). I purchased this for an additional (and longer) cable for a Playstation 3 controller. It works perfectly (although I realize now I would have preferred a few feet longer - oh well). The fact that it comes in Amazon&rsquo;s hassle free packaging is another definite plus, although since the box was rather large, when I received my package in the mail, I thought perhaps it was the Blu-ray movies I&rsquo;d purchased shaking about.

                                My laptop has quickly become my development machine for smaller projects, especially after I purchased a low-end desktop to host the Subversion repositories. I recently added ELMAH support to one of my sites, but since I run 64-bit, and have been using the built-in&nbsp;Cassini for quick development, I started getting a message in Visual Studio 2010 saying "ASP.NET runtime error: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Data.SQLite' or one of its dependencies.

I started with the absolutely beautiful Nolita, then the okay La Biographie De Luka Philipse, La Disparition, and then a big shopping spree of Not Going Anywhere, Keren Ann, and Lady &amp; Bird.

In part two of this series we used LINQ to XML to query the XML file with the data we want to display. This time we'll be doing the heavy lifting of actually creating the chart and displaying it to the user. For ease, I'll be implementing very basic caching. Preliminary requirement Before you can use the charting functionality you need to have a reference to System.Web.DataVisualization.

                                For a while now I've been meaning to work with ASP.NET 4's built-in charting functionality. While I was going to use it alongside my gas tracking, I think I'm instead going to use my Odin Sphere leveling guide, so I don't have to create an XSLT for the output. In this part of the series I'll outline the data model I'll be using, and preliminary setups. Method So that this can easily be deployed anywhere, I'm going to opt not to use the control itself, but rather programmatically create the charts/graphs.

                                This is a review of The 12 Chinese Animals, written by Master Zhongxian Wu. Like everyone who&rsquo;s been to a Chinese restaurant, I&rsquo;m well aware of the 12 animals. Thanks to Philip K. Dick I&rsquo;ve got a couple copies of the I Ching around the house, and enjoyed learning about the Asian philosophies during college. This last aspect of me was pleasantly surprised reading through this short work, as the author does a good job of explaining that there are not only animals for the years one is born, but also for the month, day, and hour.

                                A white light. A yellow. A group of kids, playing a game of basketball, laughing, not keeping score. Lights illuminating plants, a woman straightening her's in a newly purchased house, one she may not have been able to enjoy before. It was Ray Bradbury, I believe, who wrote of a man who walked at night, and before being arrested for doing so, thought of the people sitting inside, their faces illuminated only by the light of a television.

                                The more I do with Microsoft technologies the hard it becomes for me to want to move outside of them. With the .NET Framework and Visual Studio 2010, which is the best development tool I think I've ever used, it's easy to get sucked in. Since I've wanted to experiment with it for a while, and since I needed to do some kind of development after slacking off this weekend, I looked into creating a simple Silverlight application that would use the same Web service I created late last month.

                                Every time I setup SyncToy I always, always, forget to setup the folder pairs correctly. SyncToy uses per-user folder pairs, which means that if you'll be running a scheduled task using a different user, you'll want to login as that user, setup the folder pairs in SyncToy, run the sync via SyncToy's interface, and then setup the task. If you don't do this you'll just end up with a 0x1 return code.

                                When a DateTime is converted to JSON in a WCF Web service (WebHttp in this particular case) it's semi-difficult to convert that to something we can use when we return the date to a client via JavaScript. For example: "LastPlayed":"\/Date(1278187099000-0400)\/" After almost an hour of research and goofing around with this, I've come up with the following, which seems to work just fine on Internet Explorer 8, Firefox 3.6, and Chrome 5.0.

                                While I don't use Microsoft or Google's CDNs for jQuery, I do have a separate sub-domain where I serve these files from (and will eventually use a CDN, I'm sure). However, this means that in Visual Studio I miss out on the helpful documentation functionality. Based on a comment on 3 reasons why you should let Google host jQuery for you it turns out there's a fairly easy way to get Intellisense; simply include the following in your JavaScript file.

                                On February 16 of this year I purchased a HP Compaq Presario&nbsp;CQ60-615DX laptop. Almost&nbsp;4 and a half months later I regret nothing. At some point during my college career -&nbsp;either my Sophmore or Junior year, which means 2000 or 2001 - I purchased my first laptop, a Dell. I used it for a number of years, but one day it just wouldn't start back up. Ever since then I've purchased HP desktop computers, and while I've helped others purchase laptops, and have thought about buying one, the price for the machine I wanted to build just wasn't in line with what I wanted to pay.

                                This weekend I finally installed SQL Server 2008 R2 to my Windows Server 2008 R2 machine. After a bit of back-and-forth about which version to install (since my MSDN subscription allows me to install seemingly every version), I opted to just install SQL Server Express 2008 R2. Being part of the Web Platform Installer, the entire process was extremely easy. Step 1: Start Web Platform Installer. Step 2: Select SQL Server Express 2008 R2 and SQL Server 2008 R2 Management Studio Express from under Database.

                                See the table of contents for more information. In this series we&rsquo;ve started with a new loan class, that contains information about a loan, including the total amount due, how much is to be paid per payment, the interest rate, and etcetera. A method is available that will generate information about the number of payments required to pay off the loan. In the second part we created a WCF WebHttp service, or a WCF REST service, to use the class/assembly from that loan object and return XML data for GET requests.

Ths object has a handful of properties and a method to update a list of payments to bring the loan to $0. This time we&rsquo;re going to create a Web service to respond to requests from data. Requirements As this seems to be built for .NET Framework 4, you&rsquo;ll want to be running Visual Studio 2010 and .NET Framework 4.

                                See the table of contents for more information. As already noted in the table of contents, the end goal will to have a service that returns enough information to be able to generate an amortization&nbsp;schedule for a loan. I&rsquo;m not in financial services, and haven&rsquo;t been very good in math since some point in high school, but this seems to work fairly well. The first thing we&rsquo;re going to do is generate an assembly that we&rsquo;ll then use in the WCF WebHttp service.

                                A while ago (a year and a quarter)&nbsp;I created an amortization schedule generator in ASP.NET, as an attempt to help me determine when I could expect to have a loan paid off, depending upon how much money I threw at it. For better or worse, some of the practices I put in place aren't the best, and either way I've been meaning to tweak the interface so that I could do various comparisons.

                                A new feature in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is the ability to work with Virtual Hard Disks (VHDs) directly within the OS, by booting from them or mounting them as additional drives. While I've had a good deal of experience with using VHDs in virtual environments, being able to work with VHDs directly is fairly new, and leaves some question as to how useful it could potentially be, since I'm happy using VirtualBox to work with virtual machines when I need to do any testing.

                                I have an old Windows XP machine that I know is out of date, in particular as regards the drivers, and potentially for some old software that I've forgotten I've even installed. Years and years ago it was possible to run a scan, online, on a CNET, or the like, site, which would tell you exactly what applications you had installed that needed to get upgraded, based on DLLs. Dan Conderman recommended Driver Detective, which is a free and pay service, which looks to provide part of that.

Of the latter we can only make guesses and assumptions, albeit educated ones, but cannot know with certainity that they were the case. Given that two vehicles are heading towards each other at speed, and neither will be able to stop in time, we can know that they will hit each other and cause a certain amount of damage, knowing the speeds they're going, the integrity of the vehicles, and etcetera.

                                I know I should know them better so I've been looking into WCF Web services, with a heavy lean towards an implementation based on REST principles. After a good deal of research, where it was highly suggested that while ASP.NET MVC may make sense, WCF is still the way to go for Web services, I stumbled upon WCF WebHttp Services, which uses functionality released in .NET 4. After a painless install via Visual Studio 2010's Extension Manager (more information), and troubleshooting a stupid mistake on my end, I was able to quickly create a Web service that uses an assembly I had created to parse one of my iTunes Playlists to Xml files and return a listing of tracks for a particular artist.

                                The code contained below is a rough draft, and will eventually be moved into an assembly, and the code posted. At some point in 2007 I started keeping track of my gas mileage in an XML file, with a custom DTD for validation (and intellisense in oXygen). I present below the code necessary to create an rough object from the XML, and the LINQ to parse it out.

                                When I first started downloading files, almost a decade and a half ago, I would just download everything to one directory, using whatever name the file originally had when I was downloading it. In the last couple of years I've been trying (despite Chrome's default method trying to push be back)&nbsp;to be much better about saving files, by creating a directory with the full name of the application - "Microsoft Web Platform Installer" - and then saving the file(s) into that directory.

                                This afternoon I setup a machine for the following purposes: to serve as a test bed for Web development to serve as an always-available Subversion repository server to serve as a repository for shared downloads, across all my machines As time goes by the scope of the server may also change. But for now, this will work just fine. Choosing an edition The first step was to install Windows Server 2008 R2.

                                The Dover Edition of The World as Will and Representation: Volume I, translated by E.F.J. Payne, suffers from a sparse table of contents, covering only the starting pages of the four books and the appendix (the index being contained in the second volume). To remedy this, I&rsquo;ve presented below an expanded table of contents for this work. Expanded Table of Contents for Volume I Translator&rsquo;s Introduction (v - xi) Preface to the First Edition (xii - xvii) Preface to the Second Edition (xviii - xxvii) Preface to the Third Edition (xxviii) Selected Bibliography (xxix - xxx) Contents, Volume I (xxxi) First Book: The World as Representation.

                                This is a review of Manufacturing Depression: The Secret History of a Modern Disease, written by Gary Greenberg. I selected this book based on the following lines of a highlighted review: &ldquo;He offers a measured dose of philosophy in contemplating whether unhappiness should be regarded as a disease or instead as an essential part of being human. Ultimately, his book is a sobering critique of the marketing wizards who have overhyped the dubious benefits of antidepressants and of an American public all too eager for quick fixes to life&rsquo;s inevitable challenges and disappointments.&rdquo; Unfortunately, the philosophical aspects are barely touched upon, focusing instead on the historical aspects, and current state of affairs.

                                While not necessarily a step forward from version 0.4.5 of Music Recommendations Please!, version 0.5 is nonetheless a positive step. Consider this an idea-based release. As such, this application is in no way final (but might be more complete after this long weekend). Download Music Recommendations Please! version 0.5, beta. You can see a general idea of where I'd like to end up by reading my music application idea. .NET Framework 4 is required for this application.

                                Surprisingly, it was way back in September of last year that I realized Music Recommendations Please!, which I hoped would help me discover new music (and perhaps help others as well). Since then&nbsp;I haven't used it as much as I would have hoped, but that's mostly because I'm not happy with how easy it is to get more than one artist in at a time, and generate helpful 'reports' from data returned for multiple artists.

                                After converting one Web site over to ASP.NET MVC 2 yesterday, I ported my second one today. The first Web site was originally just a bunch of static HTML pages, so it was fairly easy to move over. This one, LogParserPlus.com, gets all of its data from a collection of XML files. Using LINQ to XML the files are read and parsed out to the page, using a Repeater control. Unfortunately, when I was creating the site I had run into issues with that Repeater control not acting as I would have liked.

                                On Saturday (when I'm actually writing this, but I can't have 3 posts on one day, after my posting history the last handful of months) I finally ported a Web site over to ASP.NET MVC. The existing Web site was for a client who just needs a simple, static, Web site, with a half dozen areas for content. However, if they were given the ability to directly post content to the site - news, specials, etcetera - I believe they might.

                                Under seemingly new ownership, Cassini 4.0 has been released, via Google Code. Since a download isn't available, a link to a built version is included below. Download Cassini 4.0, based on revision 4. Visit Cassini on Google Code to see the nice new interface and functionality. Of major importance is that it supports .NET Framework 4. Tested on a Windows 7 Home Premium, 64-bit, machine. Note on building it yourself To save you some time, if you want to build a copy yourself open the project properties and on the Build tab check "Allow unsafe code."

After first, rightly, attacking Apple's iTunes and iPod (and related) platforms as being slow and unwieldy, especially on the predominate operating system Windows (not even mentioning Linux), and overall behind on the times, Farhad moves us from syncing our music collections out to the cloud.

                                I like working close to the metal. It's enjoyable, even when it's difficult. Heck, overcoming the difficulty is sometimes the only fun thing about a project! But Microsoft's Web Platform Installer makes tasks so much easier to perform. And as much as I hate to admit it, I really like it. For the last handful of hours I've been getting a Windows Server 2008 R2 machine where I want it. This involves installing ASP.NET 4, ASP.NET MVC 2, FileZilla Server, disabling services I won't be using, and etcetera.

                                After receiving my instant streaming disc for the Wii a long while back, I finally popped it in my Wii and gave it a try. For this experiment I watched three episodes of 30 Rock: Season 1. I wasn't expecting much for quality, and each episode isn't very long, so I thought I was giving the Wii a very good chance. Overall, I was extremely impressed in the entire experience, and definitely think Nintendo's own video channels can learn a lot.

                                Spending the day researching all things DNS, I eventually came upon Jim Scott's post on C# Traceroute using .net framework. After a bit of tweaking, I've got something that I like a bit more, because I really want to know what the IP address means. The code for the assembly and console application are included below. Written against .NET Framework 4 (in Visual Studio 2010), but if you change the String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace() reference, you should be able to compile this in 3.5.

A while back, after visiting the doctor and finding that the pain I was experiencing every once in a while in my hands was probably caused by my cutting off the circulation to the underside of my arm, I started looking at options to keep myself from cutting off circulation, as I noticed I was doing.

                                With CollabNet releasing a new version of Subversion Server (1.6.11), and TortoiseSVN having a release a few days earlier, it's time to do an actual update, instead of a comment like I did last time. Environment I'm currently running CollabNet Subversion Server version 1.6.9.1 on Windows 7 Home Premium, 64-bit. The install directory is C:\Program Filies (x86)\CollabNet\Subversion Server\, and I'm installing version 1.6.9.11. These instructions should work, with minor changes, for other versions of CollabNet Subversion and Windows.

                                This is a book review of Rant: An Oral Biography of Buster Casey, written by Chuck Palahniuk. Rant, like the rest of Chuck Palahniuk&rsquo;s works of fiction, features sex, facts which may or may not be true, and distinctive characters. However, while told in an interesting way, through the voices of over a dozen characters, Rant seems more of the same-old Chuck Palahniuk, and I fear I may have read the last of his work.

                                This is a book review of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: Dawn of the Dreadfuls, written by Steve Hockensmith. First, I haven&rsquo;t read Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, and didn&rsquo;t realize that this was a prequel to that tale. However, as one who has been known to enjoy a zombie movie, now and again, this short tale was rather delightful. The language only flirts with being period, so there&rsquo;s no worry of slogging through any of that.

                                I've had this code for a while, but here's some simple code to pull a listing of Flash videos (FLV) from a directory, display them in a drop down, and have a video player dynamically generated based on what's picked. This uses OSFLV Player, version 3 specifically, but can be tweaked for the current (as of this post) version 4.0.

                                Resonance of Fate, available for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 (I purchased for the former), has a vast amount of data associated with it, as RPGs usually do. Because I usually do, I started keeping track of levels and etcetera for the game, which is available as an XML data file. The data is currently raw (and as of this post need to finish adding data that I've got on paper and on another computer), without styling, but I've been sitting on the information for far too long.

                                The following book review is for Imar Spaanjaars&rsquo; Beginning ASP.NET 4 in C# and VB. While I&rsquo;ve already read Beginning ASP.NET 3.5 by Imar Spaanjaars and moved rather far beyond it, when I had the opportunity to recieve his new book on ASP.NET 4 for review, I took it. Would I still feel strongly about recommending his work as the #1 choice for those new (or relatively new) to ASP.NET? Would it offer enough new content over the previous iteration that I&rsquo;d recommend a new purchase if someone had the first?

Received next movie, but since it's noticeably cracked, and I don't want to risk it, putting it right back in the Milwaukee (3079) mailer I received it in.

                                I thought I posted this before, but I guess I did not. Here&rsquo;s one way to dump a JavaScript object for analysis (if you don&rsquo;t have access to Firebug, or a similar tool). Note it only dumps one level of data, and the code below is specifically for dumping an exception (catch ex), but swap ex in the three spots one spot with whatever object you&rsquo;d like dumped. var objectInfo = &ldquo;&rdquo;; // Change ex to whatever object you want to debug.

                                One of the applications that I consistently run across all my machines is Serious Samurize. After first finding it, years and years ago, it's quickly become a requirement&nbsp;for getting work done. While some people may have much prettier, and extensive, configurations, I prefer something that I can let sit on my screen on top of everything&nbsp;(assuming Windows doesn't let other applications bump on top of it every once in a while), giving me only the information I need.

                                I recently had need to install and test WordPress for some possible work. While I was tempted to go the Linux route, shortly after the OS was setup I decided to skip that and stick with Windows. Since Microsoft has released a platform that supposedly makes it easy to install Web-related applications, I decided to give it a try to determine just how simple it was. What follows is an overview of the setup process to install WordPress 2.9.2 on Windows Server 2003, using Microsoft's Web Platform Installer.

                                While Web application development is just as complex as other application development, if not more so, it&rsquo;s fairly difficult to find information on best practices while doing Web development. In order to move towards implementation of Subversion, I needed to write up documentation on how we&rsquo;d use it. After a couple drafts, which I ended up scrapping almost completely, I came up with the below. In the interest of sharing, I&rsquo;ve included the full document below, after removing the few instances where I had to specify a non-Subversion application (our help desk application).

                                For the last handful of months I've been thinking about accessing the Internet, and otherwise being productive,&nbsp;while on the go. A number of months back I picked up an HP device with Windows Mobile, unfortunately, after a few months the short battery life and inability to run the applications I wanted/needed to be truly productive forced me to sell it and start looking elsewhere ... iPod Touch The iPhone had been out for a while when I started looking at what&nbsp;an iPod Touch could offer.

                                Promising a real comment moderation system, BE.NET 1.6 was released a few days ago. Having just upgraded from 1.5.0.7, I wasn't without my issues, but overall the memory footprint doesn't seem too horrible (it's increased a bit again, but ...) Actually, the memory footprint isn't a minor issue. I have 805 posts with 688 comments, and get between 9 to 10 thousand visits a month. BlogEngine.NET starts at around 150 MB of RAM and jumps up to 210 MB.

                                For various reasons, I had need to install Windows XP on a new virtual machine earlier today (with Windows 7&nbsp;64-bit&nbsp;as the host). For whatever reason, when getting to the point of accepting the licensing terms, before installation, I was unable to&nbsp;use the F8 key. After searching about,&nbsp;I found&nbsp;a number of Mac and Ubuntu users with the same issue, but no Windows users. The left control, shift, alt, and even right control (which I knew wasn't going to work, but an Ubuntu user swore by it and I was out of options) buttons did nothing to help.

                                From what I've been able to determine, setting up an ODBC connection in Windows and using that for ASP.NET generally seems to be frowned upon. Instead, ASP.NET uses a Web.config&nbsp;file to store a number of settings, including all the connection strings you'll be using (whether you're using Windows authentication or user names and passwords). For example: &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;configuration&gt; &lt;appSettings/&gt; &lt;connectionStrings&gt; &lt;add name="TestDatabase001Reader" connectionString="Data Source=192.168.56.102,1433;Initial Catalog=TestingDatabase001;User Id=DataReader;Password=DataReader" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/&gt; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt; &lt;system.web&gt; ...

                                The following is a review for Borderlands, available for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. I specifically played the Playstation 3 version, but my review should be applicable to the Xbox 360 version as well. What I was expecting After all the hype and reviews I was expecting a ripe-off, albeit a&nbsp;fairly good&nbsp;one, of Fallout 3. Of course, Diablo II with it&rsquo;s randomly generated baddies and weapons (and drops in general) was also mentioned.

                                Cassini is the product of Dimitry Robsman, and allows ASP.NET applications to be run without&nbsp;a full-fledged instance of IIS. While Cassini should not be used in production environments, it's more than enough to run for minor development, or even minor projects. The last official version of Cassini at the time of this writing&nbsp;is 3.5.0.2. Since he's released the source, you can build your own, but what if you just want to download a pre-built version?

                                Keeping with the tradition started here, a list for 2010 is also available. Having only listened to the radio a few times over the last year, I have a good idea of just what music I&rsquo;ve listened to, since my iPod keeps track of everything. With the help of iTunes Playlists to Xml&nbsp;and LINQPad, here&rsquo;s my favorite new (to me) album purchases of 2009. To be on this list I must have purchased the album in 2009.

                                At the beginning of the month I wrote a post on how to find BlogEngine.NET comments that had not yet been published/approved. Having purchased a copy of LINQPad a short while ago (autocompletion costs, the program with all other functionality does not; give it a try if you develop in .NET - it's very cool), and having got slammed this morning with some spammer who had an hour to kill, I decided to adapt my code for LINQPad.

                                Having created an overview of how I wanted to craft a simple journal in XML, I next created an XML Schema Definition for the simple journal to validate against. Having now crafted a Web&nbsp;application to create the XML files I'm able to move onto the prettier aspects of display for the XML files. I've created a sample simple journal that uses an XSLT (XSL Transforms, or extensible stylesheet language transformations) to make the display a little prettier.

                                In the first part of this series I had outlined a sample layout that I wanted to use for a series of XML files that I would be creating over the course of 2010. This time I'm going to create the actual XML Schema Definition file with &lt;oXygen/&gt; XML Editor, version 11.1. I've been using &lt;oXygen/&gt; since January 2008, and wouldn't trade it for any other XML editor. If you don't have &lt;oXygen/&gt; you can still follow along.

                                In a previous series, I went over the process of creating a new XML document to store my video games. (Although in that case I used a DTD.) This time I&rsquo;m going to work on a schema to store quasi-journal entries, which I&rsquo;m hoping will help with my goal to write every day. What I hope to accomplish Ultimately I want to store a bit of text for any particular day.

                                SQL Server Express is an easy way to add Microsoft SQL Server to a Windows-based server. While limited in functionality, SQL Server Express is still a viable solution. In this article I'll be covering a custom install of SQL Server Express 2008 on Windows Server 2003. Server system For this install I was running Windows Server 2003 R2, Enterprise Edition, Service Pack 2 on Sun VirtualBox, with 256 MB of RAM.

                                In no particular order, here are the video games I'm currently looking forward to playing in 2010. Note that some games may have been released earlier. Consoles that games can be released for are the PS2/PS3, Xbox 360, or Wii (which therefore includes GameCube games). Since I will probably not be getting an Xbox Live Gold subscription this coming January, and am going to go back to playing RPGs on PS systems only, when possible, PS3&nbsp;versions of multi-console releases&nbsp;will be higher on my list.

                                Situation 1: WebKit Microsoft drops all active development on Internet Explorer 9. Instead, they throw their full support (development team)&nbsp;behind WebKit. Apple, with Safari, and Google, with Chrome, are already behind WebKit. Apple&rsquo;s implementation on Windows, via Safari for Windows, is shoddy at best, and Google&rsquo;s Chrome is a completely slimmed down version. By getting Microsoft&rsquo;s support behind the engine you have an experienced team that has already developed for Windows.

                                Unfortunately, BlogEngine.NET doesn't currently have a very good way to determine, at a glance, all of the comments that haven't been approved. While this will certainly be coming in a future release, or as an extension, I figured writing something simple to do this would be a good LINQ to XML test for me.

                                Did you know you have to go through 4 screens - 3 of which are adverts - to turn off Xbox Live auto-renewals? And it seems like there's only one click (or one purchase) to turn them back on.

                                I have a large collection of repositories, and until now ran a single batch file that had to be updated each time I created a new repository, to add the new directory. To combat that, I did some research and created a new batch file that does all the heavy lifting for me. To save others time, I present it below. SET timeVar=%date:~10,4%%date:~4,2%%date:~7,2% SET repoDumpDir=..\repos_dump FOR /D %%G IN (*) DO svnadmin dump %%G &gt; %repoDumpDir%%%G%timeVar%.dump PAUSE The key items are the repoDumpDir variable, which you'll want to set accordingly.

                                Edgeworks Abbey and E-Reads have recently (2009) begun reprinting Harlan Ellison's works (32 titles in total). No Doors, No Windows sounded like a good choice, from the few titles I was missing, so I picked up a copy. This collects 16 stories, and has the introduction from the original release. Most of these stories were new to me, but they're short (the book is just under 200 pages, with the intro) and for the most part just aren't as good as his other works.

The current version can be downloaded from this post regarding version 3.5.0.2 but requires that you first build the solution (the code is available under a MS-PL license). Cassini++ is also available from Codeplex, and has GUI improvements, among other changes (but is based on an older 3.5 version of Dmitry's release).

The scratch pad (the unlabeled text box) will no longer clear when a new query is performed. Currently under development, Log Parser Plus (not be confused with the Web site LogParserPlus.com) is a tool to (hopefully) help work with Microsoft Log Parser. Download Log Parser Plus 0.3 BETA. You will need to download and install Microsoft Log Parser for this application to run, as well as .NET Framework 2.0.

                                Today I received my instant streaming disc for the Playstation 3 from Netflix. Having now moved around and watched a video, here are my thoughts. Note that I've watched Netflix streaming videos on my PC as well as on my Xbox 360. Thoughts As noted, currently the streaming capabilities require a disc. While this could perhaps be a download (and will be in the future), I don't believe it's too terrible that it requires a disc.

Microsoft Log Parser is a command line-based utility useful to parse IIS logs and more. While a number of applications exist to help use Log Parser, as well as a number of sites containing Log Parser queries, I haven&rsquo;t been very happy with them. In an attempt to make it even easier to work with Log Parser, I present version 0.2.1 BETA of Log Parser Plus (not to be confused with the Web site, LogParserPlus.com).

                                I'd really like to implement membership providers in my Web applications, but just don't have the user-base that requires SQL Server (Express), nor the memory on my production server. Having looked at SQLite before, I figured it would be exactly what I'd need, without going to the alternative of XML. After some research I found Roger Martin's SQLite Membership, Role, and Profile Providers, and finally decided yesterday to implement these on a dummy MVC site.

                                The following goes through the steps needed to setup&nbsp;Windows Server 2003, with Web server capabilities (IIS 6 in this instance), on a Sun VirtualBox virtual machine. Why Windows Server 2003 when Server 2008 is out and available? Because a large number of hosts (mine included) haven't made the switch yet. Requirements Sun VirtualBox. We want this in particular for the great networking functionality, but other apps, like Microsoft Virtual PC, will work fine as well.

I received a free copy of this book for review purposes from Amazon Vine, but was planning on purchasing the book nonetheless (I just had the good fortune to get a copy before they were all taken). A great introduction to ASP.NET MVC Professional ASP.NET MVC 1.0 was my first real look at ASP.NET MVC.

                                To those who cannot travel outside the normal flow of time, it matters not whether time travel is possible, for they would be unable to determine if the past had changed (assuming it even possible). This thought came to me a moment ago, as I was about to watch the eighth episode of Cosmos.

                                The following is a review of Muramasa: The Demon Blade, for the Nintendo Wii. Let&rsquo;s get it out of the way; Muramasa: The Demon Blade is the game that finally made my purchase of the Wii worthwhile. Muramasa is in some ways similar to Super Metroid in that you progress around the game by moving from screen to screen, with enemy battles occuring randomly, as you move towards the act&rsquo;s boss.

                                Previously posted on Facebook: 80's Linda Hamilton; sure, she did T2 in the 90s, but I bet if you think Linda Hamilton, you think 80s. Am I wrong? Rob Lumley brings up Terminator 2 as being his reason he'd go with 90s Hamilton. I'd agree with you on the Terminator franchise, but, obviously, not with Hamilton being better in the 90s solely because of T2. Look at IMDb - http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000157/ TV, movies, TV, movie (T2), and then back to TV, never to return to movies (meaning non-direct to VHS/DVD).

                                There aren't too many good gamer's games on the Nintendo Wii, so when Muramasa: The Demon Blade started getting advertised, I started getting really excited. Finally,&nbsp;a reason to dust off the Wii and play something other than Virtual Console games. With 108 blades available, Muramasa is also a completionist's dream. With the interest of making it a little easier to determine what weapons are available, I've crafted the following file, listing all the blades with their type, attack, secret arts, and effects, as well as which of the two character's trees it belongs to (those shared blades are noted as such, however some I still need to set).

                                I purchased an HP Pavilion a6360t with Windows Vista Home&nbsp;Premium&nbsp;and later upgraded it (due to a conference) for free to Windows Vista Ultimate, and then added a second hard drive. What would happen when I upgraded to Windows 7 Home Premium? Could I use the 64-bit version? The answer to these questions is, due to testing, below: Windows 7 Upgrading, doing a custom/clean install on my primary drive required approximately 38 minutes.

                                There may be an easier way to do this in ColdFusion, but I finally created a function to determine whether a variable exists and if it does, returns in, all html-escaped. &lt;cfscript&gt; // Checks the passed CF variable to see if it exists, and if it does, outputs a trimmed and html-ready version of the value. function checkForValueOutput(data) { if (IsDefined(data)) { return HtmlEditFormat(Trim(Evaluate(data))); } else { return ""; } } &lt;/cfscript&gt; (Obviously, this can rather easily be converted to a function.) This results in a change from: &lt;input type="text" id="someField" name="someField"&nbsp;value="&lt;cfif IsDefined("FORM.someField") AND Trim(FORM.someField) NEQ ""&gt;&lt;cfoutput&gt;#HtmlEncodedFormat(Trim(FORM.someField))#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;&lt;/cfif&gt;" /&gt; To: &lt;input type="text" id="someField" name="someField"&nbsp;value="&lt;cfoutput&gt;#checkForValueOutput("FORM.someField")#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;" /&gt; Much easier to read, and much shorter.

                                Recently I purchased another HP Pocket Media Drive, with 500 GB of space (instead of the 160 GB drives I had purchased before). Since I'd like to plan out my backup strategy, and need to backup for my upcoming Windows 7 install (which since I have Vista Ultimate, will require a deal of work), I decided to write this post. My computer's setup Currently I have a primary 450 GB hard drive (advertised as 500 GB) and a 700 GB secondary drive that I put in (advertised as 750 GB).

                                While it was at the same stage as it is now back on the 19th, I'm finally releasing the beta version of iTunes Music to SQLite. This console application finds all Music playlists in iTunes and imports them into a SQLite database (called iTunesMusic.s3db). You can change this by passing the database and source names as parameters. For example: iTunesMusicToSQLite.exe "datum.db" "James Skemp's 80 gig" You can run the executable and it will prompt for a key press before exiting, in case you want to view any messages.

                                Unfortunately, Microsoft Log Parser is unable to convert logs into SQLite. To work around this limitation I've created IIS Logs to SQLite, which will parse IIS logs and import them into the SQLite database and table of your choice. The first beta version of this application is now available. Download IIS Logs to SQLite version 0.1. This application requires the .NET Framework version 3.5 (check your version of .NET Framework). Note that for a larger amount of logs, memory usage can spike.

                                An updated version of this application was released. Download and find out more about version 0.5. The one problem I have with music is when I try to find new music that I may like. Luckily there&rsquo;s a number of services that will provide recommendations, but these are typically only based on one artist, or across my entire library (in the case of the iTunes Genius service). To make this a bit easier, I looked at Last.fm&rsquo;s Web services as well as Yahoo!

                                Similar to my post on parsing Last.fm's artist.getSimilar, I've been working with Yahoo! Music's Web services today. Unfortunately, Yahoo!'s services aren't quite as friendly as those made available by Last.fm. So that I remember, and others don't have to tackle this as well, here's the class I've created.

                                I would be willing to bet that at least 90% of the time when someone uses the phrase "I can't wait" they're lying. What made me realize this is when I read a comment the other day regarding a video game's review. In this comment the individual had basically stated that they couldn't wait for the game. At the time of their comment, however, the game was already in stores and available for purchase.

                                The following covers how to parse the XML response of artist.getSimilar, from Last.fm's Web Services. Setup and assumptions The first step is sign up for a free API account at Last.fm. You'll also need to target .NET Framework 3.5 when you setup your project, so as to access LINQ functionality. When writing the steps listed below, I was working on a Windows Forms Application, but the steps should be the same, or very similar, for other project types.

So, I've created an actual project/product page for the application. View the project page for iTunes Playlists to Xml. Comments appreciated.

                                As sometimes happens, a network share ended up going down while I was using Dreamweaver. Unfortunately, this can cause fairly major issues with Dreamweaver, if you have files still open, or if you have Dreamweaver closed, but need to open it up. Since I typically have more than one file open in Dreamweaver, and have set my preferences to remember what I've got open, I wanted to know where Dreamweaver stored the files that it was going to re-open.

                                Image for a moment two sheets of paper. On the first we have a design of a Web page. On the second we have the code (all of it) needed to generate that page. If we were to overlap the sheets of paper, so that the design covered the code, let us imagine that the overlapping sheet's background&nbsp;would turn transparent. With this in mind, we could overlap the two sheets of paper equally, with the right side of the design's sheet overlapping the left side of the code's sheet.

                                The following is a book review of Girl in the Arena, written by Lise Haines. The book read was an uncorrected advance proof, and was selected by myself as part of my Amazon Vine &lsquo;membership.&rsquo; This book is scheduled to be released in October 2009. The short version is that I give this book four of five stars. It&rsquo;s a good book, that I may read again, but it&rsquo;s not exactly what I was expecting, based upon the suggestion that fans of Fight Club (the novel) would enjoy this.

                                Based on metamorph_watercircles, and converted for use with BlogEngine.NET, watercircles is now in use on my site. The theme has a deal of special inline modifications for my own particular purposes, so it's not generally available for BlogEngine.NET users, but if you're interested ... Comments welcome. (I'm sure I'll find things I missed as the weeks go by, but any findings are appreciated.)

                                For a business to implement version control, they typically want some kind of support, preferrably that they need to pay for, and that may or may not be used,&nbsp;and that&nbsp;may or may not be helpful. Luckily, CollabNet offers certified binaries of Subversion, available for the low price of the time needed to register. Additionally, they offer support, training, installation, and hosted solutions, in addition to the large Subversion community. Compared to the other solutions out there, including Microsoft's, there's really no question on what your first choice should be.

                                Having just upgraded to VirtualBox 3.0.0, I was running into an issue with being able to access a Windows Server 2003 guest from my Windows Vista host machine. By default, when creating a Windows Server 2003 guest machine the Network settings are set such that Adapter 1 is PCnet-FAST III, attached to NAT. This allows the virtual machine to get outside, but not in. However, it's possible to add a second adapter, attached to the host-only adapter.

                                I owe a deal of thanks for figuring out the Muenchian Method of grouping in XSLT (1.0) to Jeni's article Grouping Using the Muenchian Method. It took, however, a while for me to get my mind around the method completely, and some experimentation, which I'm sharing below. Specifically I was looking to get a listing of tracks, from my iTunes Playlists to Xml application's output, and group them by album. For this, all I really need is the track's album and name, which gives a basic layout of the following.

                                There's a difference between self control and killing something off. Self control is when you hunger for something, but say no. Killing something off is when you no longer hunger for something. The former is a near-constant struggle, depending upon how often the hunger makes itself known, while the latter is, once the desire is killed, relatively easy, except perhaps during moments of rememberence. Trying to remember what it was like to have a hunger/desire of a particular sort, can be, at times, more painful than the desire itself.

                                I may get to some of these early, but here's a listing of things that I'd like to get done in July 2009. For the most part, they are technical things. Speed-up my iTunes Playlists to Xml application. The generation of the Xml output takes longer than I would like, and if a DataTable makes sense, it would be worth caching the playlist so clicking on the playlist again doesn't cause another, slow, load.

                                While working on a new version of my iTunes Playlists to Xml application, I've been playing around with the existing code, for consolidation and speed. While looking at memory usage, I played around with the StringBuilder I'm using to create the Xml output. As part of this I tried using Remove, once I had output the Xml, but experienced a large increase in used memory, after doing this. StringBuilder someSB = new StringBuilder(); someSB.Append("Some data" + System.Environment.NewLine); someSB.Append("Some more data" + System.Environment.NewLine); // Trimmed textBox.Text = someSB.ToString(); someSB.Remove(0, someSB.Length - 1); This jumped memory usage, on a pull using the defaults, against a 6460 item playlist, from ~17,000 to ~21,000 K, on my up-to-date Windows Vista Ultimate machine.

Here are a couple of notes on the base installs. With the core install, it's not immediately obvious, but you need to select Other User once the system is installed, and enter Administrator for the username, with no password. As soon as you log in, you'll be prompted to add&nbsp;a password.

                                Granted, in the case where this came up, I should have moved away from a SqlDataSource, but I wrote it using one, and a re-write isn't possible at the moment. So, I had to find a way yesterday to programmatically set the command timeout of a select, using a SqlDataSource (that was programmatically written). After much research, I found that you have to set the timeout on selecting. After opening a dummy document to see if I could determine how it was normally done, I came up with something like the following: SqlDataSource dataSource = new SqlDataSource(); // code removed dataSource.Selecting += GenericSelecting; // code removed The GenericSelecting is as follows: protected void GenericSelecting(object sender, SqlDataSourceSelectingEventArgs e) { e.Command.CommandTimeout = 6000; } Excessive timeout, yes, but it works.

Download iTunes Playlists to Xml version 1.2. This update should correct issues when the playlists are changed, as well as when the source is ejected. Instead of immediately connecting to iTunes, the application now allows (and requires) that you manually begin that process.

                                In a similar article I detailed how I was doing programmatic access of Microsoft SQL Server. However, on another project I was creating a class in App_Code. Using my method required the use of a couple additional namespaces from System.Web. That seemed a bit excessive. So I did some digging around and came up with what I believe is a better solution, for use in classes/non-Web code. First, the following must be included in.

                                I keep having to search through code to find it, so, since writing about it makes it easier for me to find ... here's how I've been programmatically making calls to Microsoft SQL Server. If I'm doing something wrong, please comment below or send me an email. Some times have been changed to dummy values. SqlDataSource dataSource = new SqlDataSource(); dataSource.ConnectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["ConnectionString"].ConnectionString; dataSource.SelectCommand = "stored_proc"; dataSource.SelectCommandType = SqlDataSourceCommandType.StoredProcedure; dataSource.SelectParameters.Add("id", value); dataSource.CacheDuration = 3600; DataView viewData = (DataView)dataSource.Select(DataSourceSelectArguments.Empty); DataTable tableData = viewData.ToTable(); //Stuff tableData = null; viewData = null; dataSource = null; From what I can tell, there's no close by doing a select this way; the connection must close after it's performed?

As with the previous parts, it seems that Ayn Rand has written the final part of The Fountainhead with two people as the focus of the part. Howard Roark is associated with this part, but Gail Wynand is obviously the secondary character. Yet, Ellsworth&rsquo;s speech to Keating, which gives us a glimpse into what Ayn Rand fears, clarifies his character for us.

Having finished Part 3 of The Fountainhead in less than a day, the whole should be fairly fresh in my memory. Yet, I have a hard time putting a second name to this part, to go along with Gail Wynand&rsquo;s, and as I did for my thoughts on part 2.

                                In part 1 of this series I wrote about the first part of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead. Having now finished part 2, I can write on it. The following will contain spoilers. I highly recommend you do not continue if you wish to read The Fountainhead with fresh eyes. The second part of The Fountainhead is devoted to Ellsworth M. Toohey, as the subtitle suggests. This further introduces a character we had met in part one, but gives us the chance to get to know him further.

                                I've known of Ayn Rand for quite a number of years. The first time I can remember her being talked about was by a fellow philosophy student, approximately one year ahead of me, who was a rather big fan of her work. At least one professor got into arguments with this student, as she'd&nbsp;bring up&nbsp;Rand's approach. In 2002 and 2003 I read We the Living and Anthem, and enjoyed them well enough.

                                To a very large extent, I consider myself to be a gamer. Around the time the NES came out, my family picked up an Atari 2600, used. I don't know who sold it to us, but I can remember going with my dad to pick it up at my school's playground (that was the meeting place). At a later point we picked up an NES, via my dad, and then my mom bought us a SNES.

                                I don&#39;t really believe in making New Year&#39;s resolutions, since it&#39;s something people do, knowing that they&#39;re going to fail at. In my opinion. So, for my 28th, I&#39;m doing something a little different, in that I&#39;m declaring that I will continue to do what I&#39;ve been doing, for a couple of key items. No more soda I&#39;ve been off soda for a couple of months, and before that I was down to just one-ish a day.

                                I back-dated my first piece of jQuery code, but have decided not to with my second. Anyways, I had a hard time finding code, written in jQuery, to pull data from an Xml file and add it to a page. Combining a couple of tutorials online, I created the following (on April 27). This was for a message, so I started out with the Xml file, creating something like this: &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt; &lt;messages&gt; &lt;system&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Test system message.]]&gt;&lt;/system&gt; &lt;/messages&gt; I wanted multiple messages to be able to be stored, hence the format.&nbsp; Next I had to create the code to pull in the message that I wanted.

                                In the spirit of Rob Lumley (rmlumley), who created #cubemusic, and after a great walk today, I&#39;ve created an original hashtag: #walkingmusic. For all those days I go for a walk (which I hope to be every Friday afternoon, at least), I&#39;ll be noting afterwards what music I listened to on my walk. It&#39;s very similar to #cubemusic, but not as likely to get you in trouble (even though I would assume there would be more than that to it).

                                This is the first piece of jQuery that I wrote, for production use, that works exactly as I'd like it to. Some code has been changed. try { $(document).ready(function(){ $('div#headerLogin') .prepend($(document.createElement('div')) .addClass('headerLoggedIn') .append('Logged in as: &lt;span&gt;&lt;cfoutput&gt;#query.displayName#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://words.strivinglife.com/logout/"&gt;logout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;') ); $('div.headerLoggedIn') .after('&lt;span&gt;Hello&lt;cfif IsDefined("query.first_name") AND Trim(query.first_name) NEQ ""&gt;, &lt;cfoutput&gt;#query.first_name#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;&lt;/cfif&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'); }); } catch (ex) {} It's for a site that runs ColdFusion, hence the CF tags. Basically it finds the div with an id of headerLogin and adds to that a new div, with a class and some text.

                                Often times, like this morning, I&#39;ve got anywhere between 5 to 60 minutes of time to kill. It doesn&#39;t make sense to do anything truly productive, so I end up visiting a number of sites. techmeme.com, dailyrotation.com, news.google.com, etcetera. Then I get desperate and visit weather.gov. However, once I&#39;ve visited these, I run low on ideas of other sites, like these, that I can visit. Any recommendations on sites that combine news, from a number of different sources, that is also interesting?

                                When I think of Europe I think of the U.K., France, then Germany. What about Spain though? Moving east, Japan and China, followed by North Korea. I realize that India should be on the list, but it&#39;s not one that immediately comes to mind. Africa, as a whole, is not on the list; only bad things come to mind (AIDs and spammers/scammers). Same with Israel; isn&#39;t it bad that&nbsp;I think not of religiousness, but rather of constant war?

                                The following is a book review of America: The Last Best Hope: Volume II, written by William J. Bennett. Taking a very short break to read some fiction, I moved from the first volume of William J. Bennett&#39;s America: The Last Best Hope, to the second volume. After reading the first I was looking forward to the second volume. I was hoping that the minor issues that I began noticing near the end of the first, would not be issues in the second.

                                The following is how I went about performing an upgrade of Subversion 1.5.4 to Subversion 1.6.0. For this I'll be continuing to use the current Windows build of Apache 2.2.x, TortoiseSVN, and of course Subversion. At this time, that's Subversion 1.6.0, TortoiseSVN 1.6.0, and Apache 2.2.11. Determine current setup. Opening the Apache Service Monitor will show the version of Apache and Subversion. In my case, that's 2.2.10 and 1.5.4, respectively. Opening TortoiseSVN's menu and selecting About will display the current version.

                                Haven&#39;t done this in a while, so here we go. In no particular order, here&#39;s the Windows applications that I use almost every day. Those used primarily at either work or home are noted as such. WinMerge (work - I use TortoiseMerge at home, when needed) Dreamweaver (work - limited usage these days at home) oXygen Xml Editor (home) iTunes (home) FileZilla (home - if I didn&#39;t use Explorer with shares, I&#39;d use this at work as well) TortoiseSVN (home) Visual Studio 2008 (home, since most of my work is still in ColdFusion at work) Microsoft Virtual PC (work) Internet Explorer (7 at work, 7 and 8 at home) Firefox (work) that free SQL Server Management&nbsp;tool (work) Google Talk (home) Notepad WordPad Things I have no choice over at work (Outlook, our timesheets application, Cisco Communication, and Track-It!) are not included.

Sheridan LeFanu&#39;s Green Tea (1871) we learn the story of the Rev. Mr. Jennings, through the letters of Dr. Hesselius. As Jennings accounts to him, he became afflicted by a peculiar malady. It happened one day, having began a work &quot;upon the religious metaphysics of the ancients,&quot; which was &quot;not good for&quot; &quot;the Christian mind.&quot; Having gone far out of the way to read a collection of particular volumes, he finds himself in an omnibus late at night.

Read about the current version of iTunes Playlists to Xml. iTunes Playlists to Xml, version 0.6b, is now available for download. Download iTunes Playlists to Xml - version 0.6b.

                                Since I know I&#39;ll run across this again ... In my iTunes Playlists to Xml application I wanted to allow users the ability to persist their name across sessions. The supported method seems to be using application configuration files; in my case, something like iTunesApplication.exe.config. However, try as I could, I just couldn&#39;t find anything solid on how to create the configuration file. First, I had to add a reference to &quot;System.configuration&quot; (in References).

Having just released version 0.3b of iTunes Playlists to Xml, I&rsquo;ve got yet another release. This release includes menus, the ability to select what data you want in the Xml, and a schema for validation. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve discovered one bug (that would have existed before) with playlists getting updated in iTunes, between the refresh in this application, and the time it was clicked on.

                                The following is a book review of America: The Last Best Hope: Volume I, written by William J. Bennett. Having read a number of articles, inspired by the historical nature of the last election, I went searching for a good general U.S. history book. I am indeed lucky that I found William J. Bennett&#39;s America: The Last Best Hope. The work consists of two separate volumes; the first covers 1492 (the &#39;age of discovery&#39;) to 1914 (&#39;a world at war&#39;), while the second from 1914 (a world at war) to 1989 (&#39;the triumph of freedom&#39;).

If iTunes is not running, it will start before this application does.

For better or worse, when I began setting up my iPod I opted to manually organize my iPod. In large part, this was because at the time I had a machine with a pretty small hard drive, and couldn&#39;t keep all of my music on it. However, with a new HP, I was able to store all my music on that computer, as well as back it up to a USB drive.

                                Mr. Bruce Springsteen, While I can&#39;t remember the exact date, or even the year, it was shortly after my parents had divorced, and my father moved out into the country, that I first listened to Born in the U.S.A.; it was one of my father&#39;s old tapes. Now, I really wonder that I didn&#39;t wear that old tape out. I was pre-teen, and living in northern Wisconsin, and raised Catholic,&nbsp;so not all of the lyrics made sense (not that I really thought about them all that much outside of remembering the exact order, so I could sing the songs by heart), so in that sense, I certainly was lacking an understanding of what they really meant.

                                As my last post may have suggested ... I&#39;ve been playing games. Here&#39;s a small taste of the games currently on my plate. Playstation 2 Shadow Hearts: From the New World was close to completion .. before I bought an Xbox 360. Persona 3: Fes still remains to be started, and&nbsp;ditto for Persona 4 ...

                                Dear whomever, Halo 3 sucks. First,&nbsp;I can only play two missions (missions implying goals) at a time because there&#39;s far too much confusion after those two missions. What did I do, and why? Is there any point? Should I just go as fast through the&nbsp;map as I can? (Having done this the last two missions, it seems to work great, assuming I can find my way around, which leads me to&nbsp;...) Second, where&#39;s the map?

                                &quot;Seriously considering purchasing a Wii (and only playing virtual console games)&quot; - James Skemp In the February 2009 edition of GameInformer, they have an article titled &quot;Hardcore Gamer&#39;s Guide to the Wii.&quot; In that same issue, on the ratings page, there is one Wii game with an 8.5. The next highest is 8.25, followed by a number of 7.75s. Since GameInformer is a magazine for gamers, I therefore make the claim that the article should have been titled &quot;Gamer&#39;s Guide to the Wii&quot; (note the missing word).

                                You know what grinds my gears? When people say that they wasted time playing a video game. For example, &#39;I was playing Fallout 3 and it began freezing at this certain point, twenty hours in; since I can&#39;t proceed, I&#39;ve wasted twenty hours of my life.&#39; Hello? What do you get for finishing the game? Not the hours that you spent playing it. Or did you? If you spend 80 hours and beat a game, how is that really different?

                                I work at the State Bar of Wisconsin, the membership of which elects a president every year. (Technically they elect a president-elect, but that&#39;s moot.) One of the things my co-workers and I (Rob and Dan) bounced off each other was a blog for the president-elect, for the three years they serve (president-elect, president, and outgoing (?)). With the Obama administration, I wonder if the time of weekly addresses is out, and the time of a more timely blog is in.

                                The following is a reply to a co-worker on Facebook regarding a particular topic. Since it&#39;s on Facebook, I probably can&#39;t link to it, but since I don&#39;t want to lose my response &hellip; I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t be as eloquent as everyone else; I&#39;m a little mentally drained on nights. That said, Obama called for all American&#39;s to be ready to make sacrifices. There is little doubt that greed (part of the great motivator) is what brought this country to the knee it now rests on.

                                To some extent, the game Battleship is fairly out of date. With today&#39;s technology, are we really calling attacks on individual areas at a time? For this reason, I put forward the following attack additions. Requirements are for the player using these attacks. Tactical Strike Requires an&nbsp;undamaged submarine. Give up one turn. If, on the next turn, your submarine is still unharmed, attack a 3x3 grid on the opposing player. Can only be used once per game.

                                Shortly after logging into Xbox Live the Xbox 360 will attempt to log into Windows Messenger, by default. While I tried to find how to disable this,&nbsp;all&nbsp;of the articles I found were irrelevant, since they were written during the &#39;blades&#39; interface. Here&#39;s how I stumbled on it. Press the Xbox button on your controller. Go to the Settings tab. Select Profile. Select Auto Sign-In. Select Disabled under Windows Messenger. For some reason I had to do this a couple of times for it to stick.

                                01/03/2009 @ 10:39 CT: The&nbsp;current&nbsp;version of the XML Schema I came up with is available for public use at http://media.jamesrskemp.com/xsd/MyBooks.xsd Currently I have a SQL database (converted from an Access database) of all of the books that I own, as well as when I read them, how much I paid, etcetera. Since I&#39;m moving a good deal of information into XML, I figured I&#39;d attempt to move this into XML as well.

                                Since college I have disliked ethics. However, I couldn&#39;t explain why. On December 10, 2008, at approximately 10:04 PM, I turned on the lamp next to my bed and wrote the following: 9 people on a boat that can only hold 8. What do you do? Even then I knew the answer. Morally, I think the answer is you (me) jump off the boat. Maybe I was reading too much Schopenhauer, but this seems like the only answer you can give.

                                While in college I heard of the Greeks who, when death was near, would throw a party. All the friends of the dying would come together to drink and merry. The dying would slit their wrists and party along with the others, his life spilling out from him all the while. While I&#39;m sure that in today&#39;s world this would never happen, my hope is that when I die those who know me will celebrate, instead of mourn.

                                Eh. I think it looks really good, but I&#39;m not sure a 3d world is what really drives me. That&#39;s about all I&#39;ve got to say at the moment. Definitely looks good, but ... if you don&#39;t want to meet people, what&#39;s the point? Side-note: Couldn&#39;t find the themed environments.

                                The other day I installed YSlow on my home machine. When I did so I noticed that they were recommending the major ad blocking add-on, but I didn&#39;t think too much of it. I was reading an article that&nbsp;questioned again (id est, old news)&nbsp;whether Chrome would strain the Google/Mozilla relationship. Since the ad blocking add-on blocks Google ads, I wonder if instead of Chrome, it&#39;s these recommended add-ons that are causing the strain.

                                A while ago I was reading a thread asking individuals what games they had last played multiple times. Unfortunately, I actually have a hard time coming up with more than a couple, even though I&#39;m sure I must have played games all the way through when I had more time (id est, in college). The only two I could think of were Uncharted: Drake&#39;s Fortune and Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots.

                                Here&#39;s what my answer is: No, I did the standard Philosophy major with a minor in Humanistic Studies. In high school I liked doing Web stuff, even though my stuff was *horrible*, but I didn&#39;t want to do that for a career (hard to make a career out of something you love, and still keep that love alive - or so they say). Originally I was going for Psychology, but I was told that wouldn&#39;t be a good field for me, and my Biology grades were horrid.

                                Mustn&#39;t ... look ... too ... closely ... (already ruined one surprise) Atlus certainly out-did themselves this time, with the Persona 4 pre-order goody. While I was expecting the &quot;Visual Data&quot; bonus to be large enough to fit behind the game&#39;s case, like the Persona 3 bonus, this one is actually graphic novel sized. Very nice Atlus, very nice. And, with reviews like this, looks like we can expect a Persona 5 in the near future.

                                So I did it. Back on November 17 2007 I purchased a Playstation 3. I had debated, back and forth, the purchase of that versus the Xbox 360. At the time the Xbox was having quite a few issues, including overheating, power block malfunctions, and the wonderful RROD. However, as time has gone by, the number of complaints has gone down. Some say that the issues are basically resolved, and you just need to find newer systems.

                                I've been working on a new theme for the site, since around 7 this evening ... and it's&nbsp;finally rolled out. This is along the lines of what I was thinking a couple weeks ago, but I actually grabbed some ideas from Microsoft's recent KB changes. This is the first theme I've created that used the widget functionality, and I can honestly say I'm still not that impressed with it. I still have to add some styles for coding that I add in, once I find a good sample (did I really just use blockquote?), and I'm sure I'll find something else that I missed, but ...

                                While FileZilla Server is one of the best FTP servers available, it&#39;s logging leaves much to be desired. However, after a couple of hours, I&#39;ve created a script for Log Parser that will generate a W3C log from FileZilla Server&#39;s logs. Save the following to a file, for example, FileZillaServer.sql: SELECT &nbsp;SUBSTR(Text, 1, SUB(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;)&#39;), 1)) AS RequestNumber &nbsp;, TO_TIMESTAMP( &nbsp;&nbsp;TRIM( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUBSTR( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Text &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;)&#39;), 1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, SUB(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;)&#39;), 4)) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) &nbsp;&nbsp;) &nbsp;&nbsp;, &#39;M/d/yyyy?H:mm:ss&#39; &nbsp;) AS DateTime &nbsp;--, TRIM(SUBSTR(Text, ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1), SUB(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;&gt;&#39;), ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1)))) &nbsp;, TRIM(SUBSTR( &nbsp;&nbsp;TRIM(SUBSTR(Text, ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1), SUB(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;&gt;&#39;), ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1)))) &nbsp;&nbsp;, 0 &nbsp;&nbsp;, LAST_INDEX_OF( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRIM(SUBSTR(Text, ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1), SUB(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;&gt;&#39;), ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1)))) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, &#39;(&#39; &nbsp;&nbsp;) &nbsp;)) AS User &nbsp;, SUBSTR( &nbsp;&nbsp;TRIM(SUBSTR(Text, ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1), SUB(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;&gt;&#39;), ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1)))) &nbsp;&nbsp;, ADD(LAST_INDEX_OF( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRIM(SUBSTR(Text, ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1), SUB(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;&gt;&#39;), ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1)))) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, &#39;(&#39; &nbsp;&nbsp;), 1) &nbsp;&nbsp;, SUB(LAST_INDEX_OF( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRIM(SUBSTR(Text, ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1), SUB(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;&gt;&#39;), ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1)))) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, &#39;)&#39; &nbsp;&nbsp;), ADD(LAST_INDEX_OF( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRIM(SUBSTR(Text, ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1), SUB(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;&gt;&#39;), ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;-&#39;), 1)))) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, &#39;(&#39; &nbsp;&nbsp;), 1)) &nbsp;) AS IpAddress &nbsp;, SUBSTR(Text, ADD(INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;&gt;&#39;), 2), SUB(STRLEN(Text), INDEX_OF(Text, &#39;&gt;&#39;))) AS Request INTO FileZilla.log FROM fzs-*.log WHERE Text LIKE &#39;(%&#39; &nbsp;AND Request NOT LIKE &#39;Connected,%&#39; &nbsp;AND Request NOT LIKE &#39;221 %&#39; &nbsp;AND Request NOT LIKE &#39;disconnected%&#39; &nbsp;AND Request NOT LIKE &#39;QUIT%&#39; Items in bold can be easily changed.

                                Do users know that they&#39;re not using the current version of their browser? While many browsers will check for updated versions (Firefox, for example), some do not. Anywho, I&#39;ve decided, looking at the numbers, that I would start adding a check on my sites to alert users if there browser is out of date, and tell them where they can get an updated version. Note that I refer to the desktop version of these browsers, and mention only the major browsers.

                                In a previous post I mentioned using virtual machines for testing. Here&#39;s the three virtual machines that I feel cover the most options for browser testing (on Windows):&nbsp; Current versions Looking at the top 10 browsers for this site, using data from Google Analytics, we have; Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Mozilla, Opera, Playstation 3, Konqueror, SeaMonkey, and Camino. Of those, Internet Explorer and Firefox, obviously, account for the largest amount of traffic, at about 86% of all visits.

                                I ran into a co-worker who suggested that&nbsp;I probably held a certain environmental view,&nbsp;because I was wearing a Grateful Dead shirt. While I knew it to be true, I&#39;d never really thought that my political views too may be out there based upon the band t-shirt that I was wearing. Wearing Grateful Dead? Liberal. Wearing Bruce Springsteen? Liberal. Wearing Fleetwood Mac? Liberal. Billy Joel? That&#39;s probably liberal as well. My co-worker Rob (looks like his domain expired)&nbsp;was wearing a OS X shirt.

                                No names mentioned, but I&#39;ve recently been using a number of virtual machines for testing purposes. One machine has Internet Explorer 6 and Firefox 2 installed, while a second has Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 3, and the most recent versions of Opera, Safari (for Windows) and Chrome. However, the virtual hard drives were 10 GB each, due to a large number of apps being installed that didn&#39;t need to be, for our browser-based testing.

                                Google has done it again. Logging in this evening, I immediately noticed the change to Google Analytics. Now you can see, when you first log in, the visits, average time, bounce rate, completed goals, and % change (default visits) for your sites. It&#39;s weird in that it shows a number of rows, and not sites (which effectively means half as many sites as I expect, as each of my sites has two rows), but it&#39;s very interesting.

                                I&#39;ve written about Microsoft Log Parser before, and even started a site around it. But, I noticed the other day that I hadn&#39;t written on how to get started with this powerful tool. Getting Log Parser The current version of Log Parser is version 2.2, which you can download from Microsoft. Installing Log Parser While it says&nbsp;supported operating systems are&nbsp;&quot;Windows 2000; Windows Server 2003; Windows XP Professional Edition,&quot; it appears to run fine on Windows XP Home Edition and Windows Vista (at least Ultimate has been personally confirmed).

                                Log Parser Plus was updated last night, during the election coverage, with the following changes: All functions now have descriptions (pulled almost completely from the included help file). Expressions have been added. Visit LogParserPlus.com for all of this information, and more, as it becomes available. (Next addition will be samples for the functions, and the start of a fleshed-out queries listing.)

                                About 10 minutes ago Fox, CNN, NBC, and ABC showed Obama winning the election. After 2 disappointments ... it&#39;s hard to feel absolutely confident until there&#39;s 100% reporting, but I&#39;m feeling pretty dang happy. :D

                                Rated 5 stars. Rate this review on Amazon. Purchase this guide or game through Amazon. First of all, this is a beautiful guide. Every time I pick up one of the Brady Games guides I&#39;m impressed with the quality of the actual item. Nice smooth pages, great colors, etcetera. About 66% of this guide deals with the story mode. This involves a checklist of items for each level, as well as hints and tips on completing them successfully.

                                Right or wrong, GameStop was in stock and selling pre-orders of LittleBigPlanet today, so I was able to pick up my copy, along with the official guide. Thus far I&#39;ve gone through four complete areas, and picked up the trophies accordingly. On only the first level did I actually get a 100% (but not the Ace award), and with the later levels, I had to retry a number of times. It seems also that there are some issues with movement, in particular from the foreground to background, and vice versa.

                                Luckily I fired it up this very morning and was alerted to the new upgrade - Gmail decided to mark their automated message as spam. Luckily I was covered under the original maintenance plan, so ... free upgrade, but even if you&#39;re not, you may want to give the new features a look. Read more about oXygen XML Editor.

                                One thing that I really like about ColdFusion is the powerful cfdump. Use the cfdump tag to get the elements, variables, and values of most kinds of ColdFusion objects. Useful for debugging. You can display the contents of simple and complex variables, objects, components, user-defined functions, and other elements.&nbsp; Of all the tags in ColdFusion, cfoutput is probably the only tag that I use more. Unfortunately, most other languages, JavaScript and&nbsp;.NET included, don't&nbsp;include this powerful, and versatile, functionality.

I have an iPod Classic, 80 GB, that I manually sync from my a620n. I have a HP Pavilion a6360t with Windows Vista Ultimate, SP1. I have a HP Pocket Media Drive, 160 GB. My method I do most of my work on my XP machine.

Hello LG UX565, you&#39;re awfully cute. Sleek and simple, and oh so light. You take pictures and video, and have nice big buttons. &nbsp; (If I would have got my phone today, instead of yesterday, it would have been 4 years and 2 months ...)

                                The newest versions of Subversion and TortoiseSVN were released just last week. My install guides for Subversion on Vista (and another with Subversion on Vista with Apache 2.2.x) and TortoiseSVN on Vista&nbsp;are still applicable. If installing Subversion with Apache 2.2.x, make sure you stop Apache before replacing files.

                                Granted, it&#39;s only a dollar more, but in this economy ... Dear James, As you may know, Blu-ray movies are more expensive than standard definition movies. As a result, we&#39;re going to start charging $1 a month (plus applicable taxes), in addition to your monthly membership charge, for unlimited access to Blu-ray movies. The additional charge for unlimited Blu-ray access will be automatically added to your next billing statement on or after November 5th, 2008 and will be referenced in your Membership Terms and Details.

                                After playing around with settings, I was finally able to access my wireless network with my HP iPAQ 110. Here&#39;s what I did. Under Wireless &gt; Wireless Security, set the model to WEP, setting a passphrase and generating keys. Make sure your wireless is enabled. Once the network shows in your iPAQ, set the Authentication to Shared and the Data Encryption to WEP. Select the key index and enter the key equal to the Default Transmit Key from the WRT54G.

Since last year got a bit long, I&#39;m going to break it up a bit. So, this post covers shipping from September 26, 2008, to about halfway through (I&#39;m not there yet, so ...). Plan changes On 12/10/2008 I moved from the two-unlimited to the one-unlimited plan.

In additon to posting the articles here, I&#39;ll be posting a number of articles to Log Parser Plus in an attempt to make Microsoft&#39;s Log Parser utility that much easier.

                                For the last couple of days I&#39;ve tried opening a Flash video within Google Chrome. By doing so, I&#39;ve effectively killed not just Google Chrome, but also my OS while Chrome attempts to cope. I noticed from the beginning that Chrome&#39;s task manager listed the Flash plug-in as a separate &#39;page,&#39; and thought it might cause issues, but this is pretty sad. I already forced an upgrade once, and and upgrading from 0.2.149.29 to _.30 now, but the issue still remains.

I also don&#39;t care much for the number of subjective questions (but at least there&#39;s a tag for it).

                                This evening I had to rename a project folder, since I was creating a site with the same name. Since I had the project (application) under Subversion, I also needed to move the repository. Here's what I did: svnadmin create b:\repos\_newName_ svnadmin dump b:\repos\_oldName_ &gt; b:\repos_dump\_oldName_.dump svnadmin load b:\repos\_newName_ &lt; b:\repos_dump\_oldName_.dump At this point I could either checkout the repository, or change where the checked out directory points to. I choose to relocate my working copy by right-clicking on my working directory and selecting Relocate from the TortoiseSVN menu.

                                Maybe that makes me out of it, but I like the Microsoft commercials. No, they don&#39;t really tell me anything without digging, but they&#39;re just fun, and sometimes even funny. Granted, they don&#39;t bash anyone like the &quot;I&#39;m a Mac&quot; commercials, but ... Keep doing them, and I&#39;ll keep watching &#39;em.

                                When Microsoft released IE 7 they also offered an image / virtual hard drive that could be used to test Internet Explorer 7, without installing it on your machine. Good idea. While they&#39;re buried, Microsoft has released a number of&nbsp;other images, which expire in January &#39;09. Internet Explorer Application Compatibility VPC Image Come on Microsoft, release some that don&#39;t expire, but that have some other limited functionality. For example, they can only be used for x hours before the machine must be rebooted.

                                A lot of people like to pull full passages from Waking Life, as it&#39;s a very quotable movie. However, the problem with that is that if things change there&#39;s a whole lot of sites that are out-of-date. And, sometimes people forget to add attribution ... I&#39;ve been thinking about ways to make this easier, and believe I&#39;ve come up with an idea. Looking at the numbers, I&#39;m working from the most popular to the least popular chapters, with the goal of having all available.

                                Recently I went ahead and installed Apache 2.2.9 to my Windows Vista Ultimate machine. The purpose of doing that was to move towards a Subversion install running on Apache. In this article, I'll be covering that installation. Getting Subversion Obviously, the first thing to do is to get Subversion. We're looking for the Windows Apache 2.2.x binaries, in particular. At the time of this writing, that's svn-win32-1.5.1.zip. In a previous guide, which you may have followed,&nbsp;I installed the Windows installer with the basic win32 binaries.

                                With the release of BlogEngine.NET 1.4.5 a bit ago ... it was time to give it another go upgrading. Quick notes on my experience: Downloaded and FTP&#39;d the zip. Remoted into my VPS.&nbsp; Extracted the contents of the zip to another folder. Unchecked read-only on the extracted contents. Backed up my complete BlogEngine directory. I had issues with roles.xml not being accessible. For some reason I had to set the owner again ...

I work primarily on the Web, so that will be my main focus from reading this book. Some chapters may not be present here, depending upon what I think is note-worthy at the time.

                                In this article I'll be covering an installation of Apache 2.2.9 to Windows Vista Ultimate. I'll be installing Apache so that you can run IIS as well (hence, Apache will be on a different port). You may want to do this if you want to run Subversion on Apache (as I do). Installing Apache 2.2 Currently the Apache HTTP Server has both a 2.0 and 2.2 version. For new development, the 2.2 version is the recommended verison, as it contains many new features.

                                I couldn&#39;t post this without creating an account, so &hellip; This is in regards to this comment.&nbsp;Full post. I agree with montysimmons - the attack on George Washington was uncalled for. However, he makes an interesting point that they&#39;ve been able to make the technology easy enough for someone from the 18th Century to understand and use. This is in fact better than saying &quot;easy enough for a child to use,&quot; which may have been better, since even children use computers these days.

                                Got a notice of http://littlebigplanet.us.playstation.com/&nbsp;in my Gmail account a few moments ago. I was unaware that LittleBigPlanet was already available for pre-order. I looked at Amazon, but, quite frankly, I want it rather quickly. BestBuy.com doesn&rsquo;t have it listed, but Gamestop.com does, so &hellip; my first online purchase through that site. Store pick-up selected, of course. What I don&rsquo;t care for is that there will supposedly be different items available for pre-ordering, depending upon where you do so.

                                This morning Charter fixed whatever issues they were having, so I was able to purchase and download the full version of PixelJunk Eden. I played 30 minutes this morning, and many hours this afternoon/evening. (When I&nbsp;shut down for the last time, my&nbsp;rank was 1013 - I&#39;m sure it&#39;s already changed though.)&nbsp; As the demo suggested, this game is the closest thing to a masterpiece I&#39;ve seen in a very long time.

                                I was big into 3d rendering in college, since I had a good deal of free time, and I wanted to do something productive. Anyways, trueSpace, a fairly big name in 3D, is now available for free, thanks to Microsoft.&nbsp;It sounds like this was for Virtual Earth in particular, but Channel 9 (which is where I heard this release notice from) points out, correctly, that it&#39;s also very valuable for games (in particular, for Microsoft&#39;s XBox and game generation tools).

                                The following is&nbsp;a book review of Apache JMeter, written by Emily H. Halili. First off, my experience with automated software/application testing is extremely limited. For the most part any testing I&#39;ve done has been manual testing. Recently, however, I was introduced to, and began using, Microsoft&#39;s Web Application Stress Tool. Because of this level of experience, Emily Halili&#39;s Apache JMeter was the perfect book for me, as it contains an analysis of automated testing (including when best to do it, versus manual testing), in addition to the introduction to Apache JMeter.

At the time I was working at&nbsp;a Culvers, which I enjoyed because of a number of people that I worked with, but I knew that I couldn&#39;t make that my profession.

                                Last time, I played around with Subversion in order to determine just how Subversion worked. This time I'm actually going to create a repository for a site to store the current version, and work through making a couple of updates. Existing site structure The site that I'll be working with is DoNotDenyMyUnicorn.com. It's a small, stable, site, that has just a few files. It's also relatively clean, with no previous versions floating about.

                                The following is a review&nbsp;for HP Multimedia Speakers, specifically HP GL313AA#ABA 2-piece USB Speakers. I don&#39;t play PC games any more, and I watch (most) movies on my nice television. So, what I really wanted from these little speakers was to be able to listen to iTunes every once in a while, and watch assorted videos online (YouTube, Video.Google, and even Netflix every once in a while). These speakers are perfect for exactly that.

                                I purchased one of these cases (Tamrac 3582 Express Case 2)&nbsp;for a Casio Exilim (EX-Z1200) that I purchased at the same time. That camera fits this case *perfectly*, so my review may be a bit biased because of that :) In my opinion, this is a great little case. The padding provided is just the right amount that, the one time I dropped my camera, my heart didn&#39;t sink. (No surprise, the camera was fine.) However, the padding does make the camera a bit larger than it normally would be - approximately 1.5 cm.

                                I've flirted with source/version/revision control since September 2006 (with Subversion), but have never really dug in to actually do anthing with it. But now, that changes. The following guide was created using Subversion 1.4.6 and TortoiseSVN 1.4.8. However, this should still be applicable. Also, because of the number and size of the images, I've limited the images shown directly in the guide. All links to these images should open in a new window.

                                The following is a book review of Professional ASP.NET 3.5 In C# and VB, written by Bill Evjen, Scott Hanselman, and Devin Rader. Having read Imar Spaanjaar&#39;s Beginning ASP.NET 3.5 In C# and VB (review), I was expecting a number of good things from this book. Imar&#39;s book is really great in that he shows you how to build a Web application with ASP.NET 3.5. However, with Professional&nbsp;ASP.NET 3.5 In C# and VB,&nbsp;you instead get 1500+ page reference book.

Additional errata for Professional ASP.NET 3.5 In C# and VB: Page 579, last sentence: Welcome.html should be Welcome.htm Page 581, first paragraph: Welcome.html should be Welcome.htm (x2) and Start.html should be Start.htm Page 628: Figure 13-1 is the incorrect image.

                                While not yet announced on the official blog, Firmware 2.41 is out this morning for the Playstation 3. No word yet on what happened with 2.40, but, that&#39;s to be expected I suppose (and unfortunately). (I didn&#39;t get 2.40 when it was out - they seem to release these in the morning, and most days I&#39;m at work in the morning.) Now if only you got something that really mattered when you got a trophy/achievement/what-have-you ...

I&#39;ll be trying&nbsp;another update this week. I recently upgraded to BlogEngine.NET 1.4, from 1.3. While it was, overall, a smooth enough process, while trying to dig into the large memory usage spike, I ran into a number of issues. I&#39;ve written about BlogEngine.NET in the past, and overall I&#39;ve been very happy with it.

                                Does exactly what you&#39;d expect&nbsp; I purchased Griffin&#39;s PowerJolt SE for use in my 2007 VW Rabbit, with my iPod Classic (80GB). The Rabbit has a power outlet that is somewhat recessed, so I didn&#39;t think some of the other car chargers would work as well. The design Griffin uses, however, is absolutely perfect, in that only the small top of the plug hangs above. This means all the power in less space then you&#39;d expect.

                                Every home should have one&nbsp; I purchased an APC Back-UPS ES 750 (BE750G) on May 10, 2008. Since I had a blackout on 6&frasl;27, I figured I could finally write a review. First, this is my first APC, as well as my first battery backup, product. I&#39;ve owned a number of surge protectors in the past, but since I had purchased a new computer, I wanted to try a backup device.

                                There's a number of resources online on how to change the default language in Visual Studio. However, none of them are correct. They all state that you should reset your settings to default and then re-setup your settings. Huh? Instead, if you modify the CurrentSettings.vssettings file, you can keep all your other settings, without the pain of having to re-import everything else. First, find your settings file, which appears to default to the My Documents\Visual Studio x\Settings\ directory.

                                The no checkout thing is weird. Had someone else (a Mac user) not a) told me about the process and b) told me about the store location, I would c) made the purchase online instead, and not gotten exactly what I think I want (/known about my other options) and d) would have been utterly confused about the checkout process :) But, the two people I spoke with while checking out were extremely friendly, and I was amazed by the quality of the store.

If you want to have a book that you can be glad you spent every penny for, BUY THIS BOOK. :D MGS4 is my first experience with the entire Metal Gear &#39;saga.&#39; Since MG has such a complicated storyline, my first playthrough involved a whole lot of listening to the cut scenes.

                                So Disk Management can&#39;t be found using the Vista Start Search. However, you can&nbsp;type in&nbsp;Computer Management, and get to Disk Management from there. From what I was reading online, as long as the BIOS sees the drive, Windows should have popped up a message asking about formatting it. Too bad you have to go through this extra step - it would have been nice to have at least seen a small pop-up regarding this.

                                We've been running into an issue, off and on, with ColdFusion MX 7.0.2 having issues with Verity collections. During one of our nightly jobs, two Verity collections are purged, through ColdFusion, and then re-built.&nbsp; Sometimes this will bring the collection down, resulting in a message like the following. Collection down after opening (10) Using the mdvdk executable, you can get some information about the collection, and even bring it back up.

                                In XML creation:&nbsp;Part 1,&nbsp;I went about creating an XML document, with&nbsp;both a CSS and XSLT, that was used to store my video game information. Yesterday I was going through my domains, and realized that it would be pretty helpful to have an XML document where I could store domain name information, since I've got too many to keep track of in my head. The layout Using lists, this the version 1 that I came up with yesterday: domains domain name created year month day expires year month day registrar servers server ip path subdomains subdomain name path server Now that we've got a layout, let's create an empty structure.

                                AVG is a pretty good piece of anti-virus software. However, as was recently noticed, it's Link Scanner functionality can be, and is, quite the resource hog. When running the installation program, it's possible to pass parameters to disable this functionality. However, there's no complete listing of parameters on the site. In an attempt to make this information&nbsp;easier to find, I include it below.&nbsp; installation without Web Shield avg_*.exe /REMOVE_FEATURE fea_AVG_HttpScanner installation without Personal E-mail Scanner avg_*.exe /REMOVE_FEATURE fea_AVG_EMC installation without AVG Firewall avg_*.exe /REMOVE_FEATURE fea_AVG_Firewall In case you do not want the AVG Tray application to start automatically, please use this parameter for the installation: avg_*.exe /NO_CC_STARTUP installation without Link Scanner avg_*.exe /REMOVE_FEATURE fea_AVG_SafeSurf /REMOVE_FEATURE fea_AVG_SafeSearch These parameters appear to be only passable to the installer, and not the setup program, that is included in an install's directory.

                                Wow. Imagine Black, but with stealth, better graphics, and less damagable property, but definitely better sound and effects. That&#39;s Metal Gear Solid 4. Despite the fact that I don&#39;t play these types of games very often, I only died three times. (Granted, I&#39;m playing one level above wuss.) However, I&#39;m not very fair in, since I&#39;ve actually been something of a collector in my travels. I&#39;ve also yet to get used to the sneaking about (oh, you have to hold the button down to grab them, then slash), so I&#39;ve basically been stealth walking about, bailing out militia.

                                The following book review is for George Shepherd&#39;s Microsoft ASP.NET 3.5 Step by Step. Based upon the title, &#39;Step by Step,&#39; you might think that Shepherd&#39;s book will actually cover ASP.NET 3.5 in detail, piece by piece. While it&#39;s true that he does this, he does it to very little detail. He also makes numerous assumptions throughout the text, which may have you scratching your head more than you usually would, picking up a new language.

                                After sleeping on it (albeit poorly), I&#39;ve resolved the issue that was stopping production on the new version of my Cross Sums Helper application. However, I need some help testing. Download Cross Sums Helper 2.0 - 67 KB (.NET Framework 2.0 or higher is required). UPDATE: Download Cross Sums Helper 2.1 - 65 KB If you don&#39;t have .NET Framework (and are on Windows) let me know - I had a hard time finding any real stats on these numbers, even from MS people.

What are these secret talks you&#39;ve scheduled with the Gavel Republic for tomorrow? The usual. Foreign aid. The new government reopened the request after the revolution. They claim to be more democratic but they&#39;ll probably be as bad as the last bunch. Giving them money they don&#39;t earn will help nobody.

But, I just discovered the other day how to pass parameters to a file using IIS 6, a virtual directory,&nbsp;and a URL that contains directories below the virtual directory. So, at work I had a horrible URL like the following (ignore the invalid space): /filename.cfm?parameterA=valueA&amp;parameterB=valueB &amp;issuemonth=4&amp;issueyear=2008&amp;groupname=publ What I wanted to do was allow someone to use a URL like this to get to that page: /enews/publ/2008/4/ &nbsp;- or - /enews/publ/2008/4 Luckily, after a lucky Google search, I found a Microsoft TechNet on this very issue, in the Server 2003 Redirect Reference (IIS 6.0).

                                This article is meant to hold some of the thoughts that I've been having about allowing a user to control the layout of a page, in particular for use within a content management system (CMS). The system would need to be able to support a user creating templates easily, but hopefully without the use of tables. In the CSS Advanced Layout Module, there is a draft specification for Template-based positioning. This uses @, .

                                The release of Appleseed: Ex Machina (2007) came as a bit of surprise to me, since I hadn&#39;t heard it was coming out (not that I generally look very hard into these things). Initial reviews seemed mixed - pretty and featuring direct John Woo influence, but no story. When I saw it was available for Netflix instant viewing, I couldn&#39;t resist. While it&#39;s true that the story is pretty simple, i.e.

                                This article contains my own opinionated opinion only. Why do most crime dramas take place in New York? Why does New York, along with Hollywood, think that they are the center of the United States? Of all the states and cities, New York is probably the most ego-centric, after all, how many cities share the name of the state that they are in? (Low-blow.) What follows is more questions, than answers, that stem from my thoughts on New York.

                                While installing Windows 98 Second Edition on a Virtual PC 2007 virtual machine, I was running into issues with IE being hijacked by the MSN connection wizard. In fact, they&#39;ve also hijacked the Connect to the Internet shortcut on the Desktop. However, if you run icwconn1.exe from the Run menu, you should be able to connect successfully, instead of having MSN try to find a modem.

                                Shirley Skeel wrote an interesting article on MSN Money titled &quot;What if gas cost $10 a gallon?&quot; All-in-all, pretty interesting article. I don&#39;t know about anyone else, but I&#39;ve been doing what I can to save money (ignoring the fact that I bought another monitor the other day), including using more energy efficient light bulbs in all of my sockets. But I wish my gas mileage was&nbsp;a bit better ... So, what do you think?

                                I forgot to comment on this the other day, when I first read the post. Jeff Atwood, of Coding Horror,&nbsp;wrote a&nbsp;piece titled&nbsp;&quot;Understanding Model-View-Controller&quot; which brought forth this response from Shmork (I wish he would have posted a site): I have to admit, as someone with more philosophical inclinations, I wonder whether the stated goal of totally separating content from representation is even a good idea. Certainly no graphic designer would sign on to that theory of the world, much less a philosophically inclined graphic designer.

                                I like Dreamweaver. After Notepad, and various other apps like it, I used FrontPage, was scarred, and was saved by Dreamweaver. However, Dreamweaver can&#39;t handle .NET files very well. So when I moved to Windows and started using BlogEngine.NET I naturally started looking at how I could edit the source files. Visual Web Developer 2005 had been released, so ... Skipping forward, I&#39;m starting to work with Visual Studio more and more.

                                According to commercials yesterday and today, the $5 footlongs at Subway are now a part of the menu. Is anyone really surprised? While the Subway near where I work is usually very busy during lunch, it seems to be especially so now. This is after they raised the prices of their subs not once, but twice. On that note, what&#39;s up with The Feast? Seriously.

                                The following book review is for the Richard E.&nbsp;Aquila translation of Arthur Schopenhauer&#39;s The World as Will and Presentation, Volume One. A brief history of my previous experiences with Schopenhauer: I first read Schopenhauer&#39;s The World as Will and Representation (the Payne, definitive, translation) many years ago. I&#39;ve also read a number of Schopenhauer&#39;s other works (mostly done by Payne) and have tried to pick up as many other works of his as I can.

However, I was notified today that a free version of 8.0 is now available. Go get it. &nbsp; Updated May 4, 2008:&nbsp;Updated the link.

                                Hello, &nbsp;I noticed a very minor mistake in Volume One of The World As Will and Presentation, translated by Richard E. Aquila. I&#39;m of the tech-industry now, where errata is a necessary evil, so ... I thought I&#39;d point it out, just in case any other fixes need be made in later printings/editions. &nbsp;On page 396, in the last sentence of the first full paragraph, we have this text: &quot;Someone who is carried off as a captive by brigands, e.g., by pirates, has the right the kill them for the sake of his liberation, not only with overt violence, but also by devious means.&quot; &nbsp;This should in fact be (emphasis my own): &quot;Someone who is carried off as a captive by brigands, e.g., by pirates, has the right *to* kill them for the sake of his liberation, not only with overt violence, but also by devious means.&quot; &nbsp;If this should be forwarded to someone else, please just let me know.

                                After all the hype, I finally had the chance to actually play a demo of echochrome, the M.C. Escher-ish game that&#39;s coming out for the Playstation 3 and PSP. The first Google result, for a YouTube video, gives&nbsp;an excellent presentation of what the game is like. However, at least in the demo, the camera controls seem sluggish. Perhaps the Sixaxis motion control would make this easier - I haven&#39;t tried it yet.

                                While there&#39;s no way to hide them all at once,&nbsp;you can make it a short chore to hide the Windows Vista Ultimate language packs that you don&#39;t use. 1) Right-click, H. 2) Allow admin privileges. 3) Right-click, H. 4) Repeat step 3 for each language pack. It takes less than a minute.

                                Hello. FYI, I&#39;m using IE 7, and it can be somewhat difficult to update my queue. Specifically, to change the format of the movie I would like to receive. When I attempt to change the format, I will either trigger the move &#39;action&#39; instead of the drop-down, while other times I can trigger the drop-down, but can&#39;t select/change to Blu-ray format. This also happens when I try to click on a title to view more details, or perhaps play instantly.

                                This is a review for the Kong Cat ZoomGroom, which is a very nice brush. A similar product is available for dogs. I picked up one of these for my cat, who doesn&#39;t much care to be held, have her nails cut, etcetera. However, she loves this &#39;brush.&#39; Not only goes this magically work loose the hair, but it seems to give a good massage, and does a fairly good job of keeping the loose hair on the brush.

                                About&nbsp;30 minutes ago I started upgrading from Vista Home Premium to Vista Ultimate, using a NFS copy of Ultimate I received at the Heroes Happen {Here} event in &#39;Madison&#39; (today). For the most part, everything is backed up, so it should be a painless install, no matter what happens. Five steps; Copying Windows files Gathering files Expanding files Installing features and updates Completing upgrade What&#39;s initially scary is the &quot;Your upgrade may take several hours to complete.&quot; line at the bottom of the screen.

                                My main computer is, once again, horribly low on free space. Running through my installed programs, I once again see the wonders of installing Java. Multiple versions of 1.4, 5, and 6. Checking my new Vista machine, I have Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 6 Update 1, but not the Java(TM) 6 Update 5 that my XP Home has. Are these really the same? Yes, yes they are (thanks for sticking with not only one versioning chain, but also one name, Sun).

                                I hadn&#39;t heard of Jing Project until I was asked. Here&#39;s my response: I&#39;ve not seen this before, but TechSmith is pretty well known, as far as the Morae/Camtasia (?) products, which basically allow you to record videos on your computer for demo or testing purposes. It sounds like they don&#39;t even know what they want to do with Jing, but it sorta sounds like they&#39;d want it to compete against other photo-sharing sites, like Flickr.

                                When I purchased my new HP a6360t, I also added in a HP Pocket Media Drive Bay, which allows me to directly connect in a HP Pocket Media Drive. In turn I&#39;m easily able to add 160GB or 250GB of additional drive space, whenever I need it, to store various media (documents, music, photos, videos, etcetera). One thing I was curious about was whether the drive I had, a HP 160GB Pocket Media Drive, could be directly connected to my Playstation 3.

                                Yesterday afternoon I took digital photo number 10,000. Between the three digital cameras that I've owned (and excluding the one that I borrowed from my sister, which was&nbsp;a gift from her friend Char), I've taken the following. From April 6 2005 to May 9 2007, I took 2924 photos with a Canon 300D (Digital Rebel). From May 18 2007 to March 29 2008, I took 6447 photos with a Canon Digital Rebel XT (350D).

                                Recently the much anticipated Photoshop Express was released. However, crawling through the general terms of use there&#39;s a rather troublesome paragraph.

                                Congrats Apple - you&#39;ve gotten away with it. Media 2.0 has pulled out their banners, and is waving them proudly, all the while talking talking about how Safari 3.1 is now a part of Apple Update on Windows. I&#39;m sure what you&#39;re more excited about is that nobody is talking about ... the fact that the size of your updates is as large as the initial installer. That&#39;s right, you&#39;ve gotten away with it.

                                I had previously covered how to install IIS 7 on Windows Vista Home Premium. This time I&#39;ll be briefly covering what you need to enable ASP.NET as well. As before, you&#39;ll want to select Control Panel from the Start menu, then click on the Programs link. Next, click on Turn Windows features on or off. Expand Internet Information Services, followed by the World Wide Web Services and Application Development Features. Since we want to be able to run ASP.NET applications, we&#39;ll need to check the ASP.NET checkbox.

                                This guide covers Windows Vista Home Premium SP1, and may differ for other versions. I&#39;ll also only be covering the basic, default, installation. A guide covering the addition of additional features, like .NET capabilities, may be released as well. While limited, Windows Vista Home Premium allows Internet Information Services (IIS) 7 to be installed with little fuss, using the Control Panel interface. First, select Start &gt; Control Panel. Next click on the Programs item, followed by Turn Windows features on or off.

                                Granted my machine came new with Windows Vista (Home Premium), but that doesn&#39;t nullify the fact that Windows Vista SP1 installation was a breeze on my business machine. The listing of enhancements is pretty impressive, and does much to alleviate the disappointments I had regarding certain aspects (such as the fact that SP1 supposedly changes the file copy/move functionality back to Windows XP; one of the things I really liked, once I found out about it, was that Vista doesn&#39;t keep working with the file action in the background, once the window is removed.

                                In the past I believe I discussed Browsershots as a great way to see what your site will look like in various browsers. However, I was looking for a quicker way to see a particular page in IE 6. After a bit of searching, I found IE NetRenderer. It only does Internet Explorer, but it does it extremely quick.

                                This is the second Supreme Court judicial campaign that I&#39;ve been aware of. However, the question is, why do Wisconsin citizens even vote for judges? If judges can&#39;t tell us how they would vote, why not just let them be elected by their own kind (whether that be judges or lawyers)?

                                Tip: If using the HDMI cable to connect your HP w2207h to a computer (such as the HP Pavilion a6360t), you do not need to connect the monitor to the computer&#39;s audio card. Duh. If you switch this, you may also need to close out of programs,&nbsp;such as Internet Explorer 7,&nbsp;in order for them to use the correct audio device.

Uninstall Norton Internet Security (there&#39;s an uninstall option through the program&#39;s Start menu). After a restart, I still needed to go back and delete the empty directory from the Start menu. Uninstall My HP Games through the Control Panel. Each one needed to be selected individually. Uninstalled Yahoo!

The tips Make sure you&#39;ve downloaded the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio Express tools as well. When connecting with the above, make note of the server you&#39;re connecting to; you&#39;ll need this for later. For example, PAVA620N\SQLEXPRESS (that&#39;s computer name \ instance name of SQL Server).

                                Xml4Ssp is a Windows XML generator for SlideShowPro. While the program still needs some work, it&#39;s pretty usable as it is. Since there&#39;s no real documentation, I&#39;ll be covering how I ended up using it to generate my latest gallery. Starting folder structure I began with the following folder structure: casio_images &nbsp;Pearl FullsizeImage Images Thumb The only folder that contained content was the FullsizeImage directory, in which I dumped my JPG originals.

                                Pre-emptive clarifications First, by a &lsquo;good man&rsquo; we specifically mean here one who is truly good. By &lsquo;good&rsquo; we mean one who, by their actions, attempts to decrease the amount of evil. By &lsquo;evil&rsquo; we mean those actions which are disruptive towards a social, unified, ordered, society. For example, murder, theft and&nbsp;pillaging. This by no means exhausts all potential issues with the below, but if one assumes the common definitions, it should make sense.

                                I purchased a Casio EX-Z1200 a bit ago, which I&#39;ve been playing around with. Overall, I&#39;ve been very happy with it, however, it outputs movies to the MOV format. While this seemed great for Apple, it wasn&#39;t the best for me. After testing out QuickTime Pro (7. something) and Ulead Movie Wizard 3.2 SE VCD (which came with the camera), I was about to settle for less than I hoped for.

                                Hewlett-Packard (HP) offers a couple of different media drives for sale. These include the HP Personal Media Drives, and HP Pocket Media Drives. Unfortunately, based solely on their site, there&#39;s no clear indication of which drive offers exactly what. In order to determine which is which, I ended up consulting both the HP site, and Amazon.com. I did take a look at BestBuy.com, but it seems they don&#39;t sell these drives.

                                The first one is great (the cranky old man). The others have their good spots, but I wouldn&#39;t feel too bad having to shut it off after he left the stage. If it would have continued at this level through the end, it would truly have been great! See what else I&#39;ve been watching through Netflix.

                                So maybe you remember watching this when you were little, or think you must have. And maybe you watched the Robot Chicken episode covering this movie. And maybe you&#39;re really tired when you decide to watch this movie. You&#39;re in for comedy gold. Overall, a pretty good movie, with a good message that won&#39;t be lost. But, older and wiser, there&#39;s just too many loop-holes, and that Robot Chicken spoof will overpower everything else.

                                Unfortunately, Crucial&#39;s system scanner tool doesn&#39;t work on Linux. While unfortunate, it turns out that there&#39;s an easy way to determine how much memory you&#39;ve currently got, and how much you can increase that to, using a simple comand. sudo lshw That&#39;s all there is to it. This gives not only an overview of how much you&#39;ve got, and how much you can have, but also what banks are in use with what, and other system-related &#39;stuff.&#39; Pretty nifty.

                                I have a 2007 VW Rabbit, which, in the glove compartment, has an auxillary input jack. Since I also have an iPod Classic, I really wanted to be able to listen to my music in my car, using my car&#39;s speakers. On January 5, I picked up&nbsp;this cable. It&#39;s a cable, so there&#39;s not a whole lot that they can mess up. From what I can tell, the quality coming out of my speakers is the same as when I use by earbuds or another set of good headphones.

                                On January 5th, I purchased a DLO Jam Jacket with Cord Management for the 80 GB iPod classic. As the title suggests, this product is designed specifically for the 80 GB iPod Classic, and therefore may not work as expected for other iPods. The quick review: Overall, this case offers a good deal of protection, and the cord management feature, if you use the standard iPod buds, is rather helpful. However, without any screen protection, minor-to-major issues with the wheel, and minor issues with the cord manager, this model may not be a wise choice.

                                Recently, I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about where I&#39;d like to be when I get older. For as long as I can remember I&#39;ve been thinking ahead - it&#39;s just the way I am. The time frame has spanned from a mere hours from the present, to a number of years. Thirty (30), though, is a pretty special kind of birthday. The fact that it&#39;s about 3 years and 3 months away for me, makes it even particularly more so.

                                After a deal of searching, I&#39;ve finally discovered why my Firefox browser was crashing so often. So often, in fact, that I have Internet Explorer 7 a chance (and it showed how much of a fight it can now put up). The short story: don&#39;t enable Firebug for all sites. Gmail has recently been warning about this, stating that slow-downs are likely. One config setting, javascript.options.strict, when set to true, can also cause issues with Google AdSense.

                                Special edition over my lunch break ... It seems Mitt Romney, former presidential hopeful, has withdrawn from the race. Guardian Unlimited quotes him as such: &quot;In this time of war I simply cannot let my campaign be a part of aiding a surrender to terror,&quot; he told the Conservative Political Action Committee As with the 2004 race, once again a Republican is stating that a Democrat president would result in the United States surrendering to terror (sadly, it doesn&#39;t look like that piece was moved over to the site, but I&#39;ll see if I can&#39;t dig it up and re-post it tonight).

                                Yes, I&#39;m still alive, I&#39;m just not posting ... Since Friday I&#39;ve been fighting a cold/flu, and the cold weather hasn&#39;t much helped. However, last Saturday morning I was feeling better, and along with lunch, picked up a camera I&#39;ll be writing about once this cold is dead. Another camera? I&#39;ve still got my Canon 350D, but I haven&#39;t used it since it&#39;s gotten so cold. I decided that if I picked up a point-and-shoot camera I&#39;d probably take more pictures.

There's a number of TODOs, but ... &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" &nbsp;"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"&gt; &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" /&gt; &lt;title&gt;JavaScript Regular Expression Tester&lt;/title&gt; &lt;style type="text/css"&gt; &nbsp;#form_help { &nbsp;&nbsp;float:right; &nbsp;&nbsp;font-size:.8em; &nbsp;&nbsp;width:50%; &nbsp;} &nbsp;#form_results { &nbsp;&nbsp;margin:1em; &nbsp;&nbsp;width:45%; &nbsp;} &nbsp;.highlight { &nbsp;&nbsp;background-color:#ff9; &nbsp;} &nbsp;#form_highlighttext { &nbsp;&nbsp;border:1px dashed #ccc; &nbsp;&nbsp;margin-left:1em; &nbsp;&nbsp;width:45%; &nbsp;} &lt;/style&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; &nbsp;function RemoveHTML(TextContent) { &nbsp;&nbsp;var str = ''; &nbsp;&nbsp;str = TextContent; &nbsp;&nbsp;str = str.replace(/&lt;/g, "&amp;lt;"); &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;return str; &nbsp;} &nbsp;function TestExpression() { &nbsp;&nbsp;var Expression = ''; &nbsp;&nbsp;var ExpressionParameters = 'gm'; &nbsp;&nbsp;var ExpressionText = ''; &nbsp;&nbsp;try { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;document.getElementById('form_error').innerHTML = ''; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;document.getElementById('form_results').innerHTML = ''; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;document.getElementById('form_highlighttext').innerHTML = ''; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (document.getElementById('InputExpression').value != '' &amp;&amp; document.getElementById('InputText').value != '') { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// TODO better check and error writing - use span with _s &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (document.getElementById('CheckCase').checked) { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ExpressionParameters += 'i'; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expression = document.getElementById('InputExpression').value; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ExpressionText = document.getElementById('InputText').value; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var ExpressionObject = new RegExp(Expression, ExpressionParameters); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var ExpressionTest = ExpressionObject.test(ExpressionText); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (ExpressionTest == true) { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;document.getElementById('form_results').innerHTML = '&lt;p&gt;The following results were found for your search:&lt;/p&gt;'; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Testing it appears to run it, so ...

                                The below information is correct for version 9.1. Comments on other versions&nbsp;are appreciated. With flash drives becoming more and relevant, it&#39;s always good to find programs that can be run on these powerful drives. &lt;oXygen/&gt; XML Editor is one such program. Making &lt;oXygen/&gt; portable On the official site, there&#39;s a post regarding making &lt;oXygen/&gt; portable. However, what does it really involve? Easily enough, it doesn&#39;t involve much more than is stated in the post.

                                I&#39;m a statistics kind of guy. I like numbers, since they&#39;re logical. I also like trends, and all that. So, here&#39;s a look at the current trends for what it takes to get into the top 25k, 50k, 75k, 100k, 150k, 200k, and 300k in the various game modes in Warhawk. Undoubtedly I&#39;ll have another post like this next month, around the same time. With over 417,000 players, total, these equate to around the top 6%, 12.5%, 18.75%, 25%, 37.5%, 50%, and 75%.

                                Right before Christmas of 2007, I purchased a copy of Warhawk, for the Playstation 3. I didn't pick it up until the day after Christmas (what a bad idea; I should have just purchased in store, but ...) and have played a mere 16 hours (94 games). With my total points of 1153, I'm only 113315 out of the 410195 players, world wide. Granted, that's not too terribly bad, but I need to make a goal if I'm going to apply myself.

                                I stumbled upon some code I had written back in September, for testing regular expressions. This uses ColdFusion, and is currently 'running' on ColdFusion MX 6.1 and ColdFusion 7.0.

                                The other day, after a deal of research, I decided to pick up a copy of &lt;oXygen/&gt;, which&nbsp;is &quot;a complete cross platform XML editor providing the tools for XML authoring, XML conversion, XML Schema, DTD, Relax NG and Schematron development, XPath, XSLT, XQuery debugging, SOAP and WSDL testing.&quot; This provided to be the key to finally understanding XML Schema, or at least getting a working Schema for an XML file. Since I&#39;ve covered XML in a couple of tutorials/guides, I&#39;ll be adding another covering using an XML Schema, in place of a DTD.

                                Catching up on the news, it seems Warner will be switching over to Blu-ray, exclusively, after May 2008. What surprises me is that they&#39;re just now saying that this is ending the format wars. The fact that Warner was supporting both, while Fox, Disney, Lion&#39;s Gate, MGM, and Sony were only Blu-ray (compared with Paramount and Universal going HD DVD, after Paramount was effectively paid-off) suggested, to me, that the &#39;war&#39; was already over.

                                Years ago I said I would never buy one. Yesterday, after lunch with my mom and sister, I stopped into Best Buy and picked up a black, 80GB, iPod classic. Of course, I was hit for various plans I could join - can&#39;t blame the guy, I guess - but left with just the iPod and Stranger than Fiction (Blu-ray), since&nbsp;I figured it was worth the $30 to make it my second Blu-ray disc.

                                In this guide, I'll be creating an XML file to store the Playstation games I own, and ultimately make the XML file 'pretty' for Web browsers. I've done this in the past, with my vehicle gas XML document. In part eight I'll be expanding upon our XSLT to group games based upon the system they belong to, as well as modify our XSLT to use xsl:appy-templates. This time ... I won't be going into a recap of what I've done in all seven of the previous parts.

                                Unfortunately, the &#39;Internet portal&#39; will continue to be around, but the browser is finally being put to rest. That&#39;s the news out of AOL, on the official blog yesterday. Personally, I&#39;m really happy to hear this, since Netscape as a browser really isn&#39;t going anywhere. Currently, it just displays content using IE or Firefox/Mozilla. Happy news indeed, and not at all unexpected. Hopefully this means that freed talent and time will be invested wisely.

                                There&#39;s been quite the party for the last 30 minutes or so. BlogEngine 1.3 was released a couple of days ago, and I finally upgraded. Unlike what I should have done, I upgraded my live installation first. Yikes. For some reason, all of the permissions on the sub-folders and files was lost. Since web.config couldn&#39;t be accessed, the site went down - hard. After a bunch of Google searches, and no solutions, I started pressing buttons.

                                Ramblings at this point. I probably won&#39;t clean them up, but I might.&nbsp; Ars technica has a post, Microsoft patent could force downloaders to view commercials, regarding advertising before the playing and/or downloading of online content. Microsoft&#39;s patent application, titled Enforcing Advertising Playback For Downloaded Media Content, describes systems that are based both on tokens and DRM which would prohibit playing a media file unless its accompanying advertising is viewed. The technology is designed to prohibit fast-forwarding, editing, or otherwise circumventing the advertisements, though it is unclear exactly where the ads would be placed.&nbsp; Now I have a couple of experiences with online video, and can therefore give my opinion on this.

                                Thanks to Rob Lumley, I&#39;ll be watching four different P.T. Anderson films over the extended holiday weekend. Brief comments on the first film&nbsp;watched,&nbsp;below. Hard&nbsp;Eight (1996) Interesting. In more than a couple of places, I was reminded of Jackie Brown. Lots of dialogue, but even more quiet, giving an emphasis to not only what is said, but what is not. It&#39;s slow, which may turn some away, but the story of Sydney is interesting all the same ...

Marcus Theatres Corporation, a division of The Marcus Corporation (NYSE: MCS), today announced it was not able to reach an agreement with Paramount Pictures on the film cost of the new motion picture, Sweeney Todd, which will be released by Paramount on December 21, 2007. "Unfortunately, as a result of the negotiations with Paramount reaching an impasse, Marcus Theatres will not be showing Sweeney Todd at any of its locations," said Bruce J.

                                I watched the Blu-ray version of this movie. Other editions may play differently, although since I don&#39;t discuss the audio or video components of this film, my review will stand as-is. This is, by far, one of the most wonderful films I&#39;ve seen in a very long time. While I haven&#39;t been much of a Will Ferrell fan in the past, this movie has truly opened my eyes to just how great of an actor he really is.

                                While I initially hooked up my Playstation 3 a week ago, when I was posting to the official PS forums today, my second post, I was doing so to recommend a version of the router I&#39;m using. Since both items are pretty popular now, it makes sense to write up a quick guide on them, I suppose. My equipment First off, there&#39;s my setup. I&#39;ve had pretty experiences with Linksys, but poor experiences with Netgear, so Linksys I am.

                                Reason #1 Mr. ROFL. Reason #2 I already own a Playstation and Playstation 2. When I can get a machine that will play those games, why wouldn&#39;t I keep with it? After all, the Playstation has never failed me. Reason #3 Free online play. With wi-fi support built-in. Reason #4 Heavenly Sword. This was the first real Playstation 3 game I played. With the trailers, I was expecting a Devil May Cry kind of game, but wow.

                                In the beginning of this month, I purchased a 32" Sony Bravia. In the two weeks that I've had the television, I've run into a couple of things that I would like the television to offer. In no particular order, they are listed below. Better volume detection Maybe it's because the speakers are better on this tv than my old one, but there's definitely an issue with commercial versus programming volumes.

                                In this world, there&#39;s a number of people who get paid for playing video games. I am not one of those people. This is a good reason to trust the people, with a grain of salt, when it&nbsp;comes to said video games. Recently, I&#39;ve been trying to decide between an Xbox 360 and a Playstation 3, for my next-gen console, since we all know that the Wii isn&#39;t next-gen. It weren&#39;t for co-workers, my mind would already be made up.

                                Recently, Gavin Schmitt asked me what my thoughts were on philosophy books about philosophers. Does that ever bother you, by the way? Philosophy books about other philosophers? Either you read it ahead of time and you don&#39;t know what the hell the author is talking about, or you read it afterwards and you end up not recalling the exact passages the author is referring to. It&#39;s like you need a FIRM grasp on the material to appreciate a book on the philosopher, but if you have that firm grasp you probably don&#39;t need to read the book (besides as a refresher).

                                In Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0, you can choose to use a number of different formats for your access logs. Access logs contain information about what files are requested, whether the request was successful or not. Of all the available formats, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) extended log file format is by far the most flexible format available, as you can select the information that you would like to log.

                                Today I purchased a new television, to replace my tried-and-true Philips 20&quot;. After a couple of months of research, and etcetera, I decided to go with a Sony Bravia. Since my previous television was a 20&quot;, purchased back during my sophmore or junior year of college, and still using &#39;tube&#39; technology, I figured it was time to upgrade, especially since I&#39;ve been watching more movies via Netflix, and am planning on purchasing one of the current next-gen video game systems (P3 or 360).

                                In January and March of 2005, I asked Gavin Schmitt, of The Framing Business and Gavin War Journal, a number of questions. Those questions, and the respective answers, have been posted below. Since his answers may have changed since early 2005, I&#39;ll be adding any additional comments he may have to the answers below. 1) I&#39;m about to read your writings - why should I? In all honesty, you probably shouldn&#39;t.

                                In 2003, I received a bachelor&#39;s in philosophy from the University of Wisconsin: Green Bay. During my four and a half years at Green Bay, I studied a deal of philosophy, without ever really deciding that I&#39;d go for a degree in philosophy; philosophy was actually meant to just satisfy the necessary requirement of picking a degree in my sophmore year. Nonetheless, gradate with philosophy I did. During those years, I studied a number of philosophers, some more than others.

                                I&#39;m a fan of PKD, but this documentary fails in a number of major areas, making it almost useless in its scope. First of all, the animations that are used in place of slides are annoying beyond _, but I suppose if they trimmed those up they&#39;d only have an hour of play time. The music reminded me of Assault on Precinct 13, and while it wasn&#39;t too bad, it was utterly diabolical when it was close to drowning out the interviewed individuals while they spoke.

                                Years and years ago I was young. My father had moved out of his parent&#39;s house by this time (meaning the time I&#39;m recollecting on), and had possibly lived at at least one other place. Anyways, he ended up living at my Uncle Pat&#39;s place. I don&#39;t recall the first couple of visits to the place, but I remember the place well enough. Recollections of the place itself will have to wait, though, since that&#39;s not what I wanted to speak about.

                                One of the view things I miss about cable is The Daily Show. Thankfully, I can now get my fix, as well as catch up on older shows, online, legally. The archives are available from the Show&#39;s Videos area. Among the gems is this one on the recent healthcare veto: Headlines - Kids&#39; Healthcare Veto. The short commercial at the beginning and end are fairly non-obtrusive, save when they cut into the end abruptly.

                                A while back, I ended up recording a number of my pieces using the free Audacity software. However, the files soon disappeared from the Web. These have been added to the respective posts, and are once again available for download. Use the listen tag to find the articles. At this time, it looks like there are just three, but more will be added.

Not a very original name, but I can see how it was created &hellip; Anyways, I&rsquo;m proud to present another theme for BlogEngine.NET, called MWRT-002. This theme is based upon the template of the same name by MyWebResource, and made available on Open Source Web Design. A zip of the theme can be downloaded from my testing site at JamesRSkemp.net. Download the zip file - for BlogEngine.NET 1.2 (tested with 1.2.0.0).

                                It&#39;s definitely a form email, with some major spacing issue. However, the email itself is pretty concise and to the point. ColdFusion development, in California. I like the first line, &quot;It is time to come out and join the rest of the people escaping the cold.&quot; but they clearly don&#39;t know me. If anything, I&#39;ll move further north :D Thankfully, I&#39;m pretty happy where I am now, although it looks like I&#39;ll be pulling in a deal of extra hours this week.

                                In IIS 6.0, you can setup Application Pools for each of your sites. My knowledge of the exact benefits of this is somewhat lacking, but what I do understand is that these help applications (Web sites) stay within their own bounds, and prevent them from having a bad effect upon each other. For example, if one application is preforming poorly, as long as it&#39;s not a server-wide issue, the other sites on the server will be impacted minimally.

                                Once again, I&#39;ve changed the template for the site. This time I&#39;m using Royal Flowers. The name comes from the purple flowers (taken outside of Madison Wisconsin&#39;s capitol building (see the Galleries for more shots) and that purple usually signifies royalty, or richness. I&#39;m not sure that the left-side navigation has been done the best it could be, but ... overall I&#39;m pretty happy with it.

                                Note: This article was written using Log Parser 2.2. Therefore, while it may work for a different version, it may not. The following SQL can be used by Log Parser to generate a chart with the total requests (for a day, month, or year) and what percent each status code is of those requests. An example chart can be found at the end of this article. First, I assume that the below is put in the same directory as the logs you would like to parse.&nbsp; SELECT sc-status AS [HTTP Status Code], count() AS Requests INTO http_status_percent_graph-%date%.png FROM ex%date%.log GROUP BY [HTTP Status Code] ORDER BY Requests DESC Once you&#39;ve saved this, you can call the script like such, so long as you&#39;re already in the directory you saved the SQL file.

                                I had previously written on how Netflix shipped and received DVDs, for Madison WI. This article continues that one, by discussing Year 2 with Netflix (first year began September 26, 2006). Plan changes On December 2, 2007, I decided to upgrade to the two at-a-time (unlimited)&nbsp;plan. Since my plan begins on the 10th of each month, that means I had to pay an extra $1.26 to upgrade now, instead of for the next month (I figure this way they&#39;ll send a movie out tomorrow morning).

                                As it promises, Steve Krug&#39;s Don&#39;t Make Me Think: 2nd Edition, is a quick, but extremely usable, guide to Web usability and design. The book took me less than a day to read (less than 3 hours total over the days of September 26 and 27, of 2007), but has become, in my mind, a requirement for even beginners (like myself) of Web design. Since everyone who develops for the Web should have some idea of design and usability, this book should really be a mandatory requirement for said work.

Or, when I signed up for something online, they must have thought that I have a child. Or, Mr. James Skamp had a child. I guess my child is about 12 months old now - I don't know if it's walking yet though - but Huggies seems to think it's using diapers (hence the coupons).

For most of us, from our earliest days we are taught that one day we will become an adult, get married, and have children. Depending upon where you grow up, what your parents think of higher education, and what their thoughts are regarding said education, going to college may also be a part of the prescribed future.

                                A few days ago my server was restarted in the early morning hours. I had been logging network and processor usage using Windows built-in performance monitoring, but when the server restarted, the logs did not. A bit of research later, it appears that there is a way to have Windows restart the logging after a system restart. To enable this, it seems you just need to have the log stop after a certain amount of time (for example, after x hours, or x days).

                                The following Log Parser query can be used on FTP log files in order to determine what user names were used to login, or attempt to login, to an FTP site. logparser &quot;select cs-uri-stem, count(cs-method) from ex*.log where cs-method like &#39;%USER&#39; group by cs-uri-stem order by count(cs-method),cs-uri-stem&quot;&nbsp; This assumes that you&#39;ve added Log Parser to your path, and that you&#39;re running this from your log file directory. This query will tell you what ip addresses successfully logged into your FTP site.

                                Note: This article was written using Log Parser 2.2. Therefore, while it may work for a different version, it may not. In a previous article, I discussed how to use Log Parser to find 404 errors in IIS log files. This time, I&#39;ve made it a little broader, by giving some queries to find all 400 codes, and all 500 codes, through log files. There may be a better way to find these codes (instead of my IN statement), but a standard LIKE doesn&#39;t seem to work.

This was originally posted to the Codeplex discussions for BlogEngine.NET, and will eventually get moved into the wiki. (Update Sept 8, 2007: Added to the BlogEngine.NET wiki, but not yet linked from other pages. Also made a minor change to step one.) Compiling source with Microsoft Visual C# 2005 Express Edition 1) Download the current source code from the Releases tab or the Source code tab on CodePlex.

                                For various reasons, I've been working towards migrating from an Apache server to an IIS one for my sites. For Gavin's site, I couldn't get away with it, but I don't have any problem making things more difficult for myself :D However, this means that old URLs may not be working as they should. My experience with IIS is a working knowledge of it, and therefore I know what I need to know, picking up what I can.

                                On July 7, of this year, I went to the farmer&#39;s market off of the Capitol square, in Madison. I picked up some sunflowers and a bunch of flowers. I ended up taking a number of pictures before the flowers eventually died, and the picture I used for the new header image is one of those taken. The file size for the image is rather large, in my opinion, but with today&#39;s speeds, it shouldn&#39;t be an issue.

I reply: A part of me, yes. But, so too is the rest of my, otherwise whole, body. So, saying &quot;this is x,&quot; where &#39;this&#39; refers to a part of &#39;x,&#39; no matter what the part, is the same, in some sense, of saying that of any other part.

                                In January of 2002, I bought a copy of the two volume set of Logical Investigations for a college course regarding major figures in philosophy, or some such. Later that year I picked up a copy of the Ideas, for another course, the next semester. Unfortunately, Husserl remained something of a mystery to me, despite having attempted to make my way through his primary works. With Husserl, part of Routledge&#39;s new series of introductory works on Western philosophers, David Woodruff Smith attempts to give an overview and analysis of what makes Husserl such an &#39;influential philosopher.&#39; With the hope that D.W.

                                I&#39;ve never been to New York City, at least, not that I can recall. However, media has, for various reasons, touched upon the city in a number of formats, in a number of ways, for a number of years. Without having ever been to New York City, I can say the following about it. Stay out of New York City. Common wisdom is right, New Yorkers are less human than people in other cities.

                                I&#39;ve spent a couple of hours, the last couple of days, playing Persona 3 (Playstation 2). After winning certain battles, you can get a &#39;shuffle&#39; mode of two or three cards (at least, as far as I&#39;ve gotten). So, you see what the cards are, they turn over, and then they&#39;re shuffled. They are all usually good, but just to different degrees; for example, you might already have what one of the card would give, and you&#39;ve been getting real crap for what another card would give, ...

                                At approximately 2:30 Sunday afternoon a Pepsi Ball was spotted around 10 Market St in San Francisco. The Ball, which eventually killed Noah Ridge, 27, continued on it's rampage in the area, striking multiple vehicles. By the time the rolling rampage was over, $250,000 in property damages, 20 injured, and a nation lies in shock. At the time of this article, Pepsi Co. refused to return our calls. Our assesement? Pepsi, fitting its marketing, once again show contempt for those outside of its shareholders.

                                It seems the XML Validation service is down/unavailable/what-have-you, and many of the other XML validators just don&#39;t seem to work. However, Validome has a pretty good service. You have to make sure you grab the right language, but, other than that ... I&#39;ve got my XML file - http://jamesrskemp.net/vehicle_gas.xml - validating with a DTD, but my attempts at getting a schema to work failed pretty hard ...

                                The following quotes are from movies. At the moment, it&#39;s just the two, but, more shall surely come. Look. The supermodel&#39;s a beautiful girl, Will. She can make you dizzy, like you&#39;ve been drinking Jack all morning. She can make you feel high for the greatest commodity known to man - promise, the promise of a better day, the promise of a greater hope, the promise of a new tomorrow. This particular ore can be found in the gait of a beautiful girl - in her smile, in her soul, in the way she makes every rotten thing about life seem OK.

                                I&#39;ve been a fan of Bruce Springsteen since I first listened to the album Born in the USA (on cassette), way back, many, many years ago. Most of the music/songs that I enjoy are because of women, but Bruce Springsteen is one of the few artists that I enjoy because of a man. In this case, my father had the tape, but it was women who gave the music true meaning.&nbsp; Anywho ...

                                Harlan Ellison is one of those authors who not only writes interesting things, but is also quite an interesting character himself (like Chuck Palahniuk, and Philip K. Dick). One of Ellison&#39;s major themes is love. He&#39;s written a good deal about it, and while I&#39;m doing my research on love, I couldn&#39;t exclude Ellison. What follows are quotes from Ellison&#39;s pieces that reference that thing called love ... On the night that he actually paid for love, the night he physically reached into his wallet and took out two ten dollar bills and gave them to the girl, the creature took full and final shape.

                                Gavin sent me an invitation way back in June to join The Names Database. This morning, having received the final reminder email, I decided to signup. However, it seems that I have to invite 5 people (5 people who have never been told about this service) before I can join. Don&#39;t know 5 people?&nbsp; Sorry. You can try adding fake people, but chances are someone already tried those (a@a.com - already invited).

The following code will generate a listing of calls that generated a 404 error. logparser &quot;SELECT cs-uri-stem, cs-uri-query, date, sc-status, cs(Referer) INTO 404report.txt FROM ex.log WHERE sc-status = 404 ORDER BY date, cs-uri-stem, cs-uri-query&quot; This assumes that you&#39;ve currently got a command line open in the folder containing your IIS logs, and that you are logging the above information, as well as that logparser is setup in your PATH line.

                                A few weeks ago, I believe, a coworker and I were talking about Google, in particular, how he happens to search for people, he once knew, online. Of course, I don&#39;t think I know anyone who hasn&#39;t at least done this once (even if that individual they searched for happened to be themselves). The question is, is it true that, if someone can&#39;t find a record of you online, that you&#39;re dead?

                                Year&#39;s ago, Microsoft released Log Parser 2.2, which is a tool for analyzing IIS log files, event viewer exports, and etcetera. There&#39;s a Professor Windows article from May 2005 which covers Log Parser, to some extent, and the download is available from Microsoft. Unfortunately, it&#39;s all command line, but it seems interesting enough, nonetheless. I would have liked to have used AWStats (and probably still will), but I just didn&#39;t want to bother with the config file today.

                                I had occasion today to read The Hospice, by Robert Aickman (1914-1980). This story was in the collection Masterpieces of Terror and the Supernatural (selected by Marvin Kaye). Unfortunately, I had to go to Google to try to make sense of the story, since Kaye himself suggests that the meaning is rather obscure. A simple G search turned up a result at some site, which itself is rather odd ... in a mysterious way.

This theme is based upon the template of the same name by Homefront Studios, and made available on Open Source Web Design. While this is technically my third theme for BlogEngine.NET, it&rsquo;s the first for public consumption.

                                Over the past couple of days I&#39;ve noticed issues with the Inbox view of Gmail being extremely slow on Firefox (2.0.0.5, the current version). Disabling JavaScript makes the load much faster (naturally), but even switching to Internet Explorer (7) works (with JS on). With Firefox 2.0.0.5 already having a security issue, I wonder if updating was a good decision in this case. Perhaps 2.0.0.5 was released a bit too quickly?&nbsp;

                                My GitS: 2nd Gig knowledge is a bit rusty, so Solid State Society is definitely going to be one of those &#39;need to watch it at least twice&#39; movies. It seems the movie takes place after 2nd Gig, and therefore, outside of the realm of the other two movies. For two years the Major has been working outside of Section 9, which seems a bit off, since I was under the understanding (perhaps just from the movies) that if they quit, they forfeit pretty much everything ...

                                I had the &#39;opportunity&#39; today to import a WordPress blog from one server to another. While WordPress 2.2.x no comes with built-in functionality to export, and then import, an XML file, I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s anything but simple and trustworthy. It seems that there may be a built-in limit to the amount of posts that can be imported. For me, I had to do an initial import (the XML file was approximately 2.3 MB), then determine which posts did come through.

                                I&#39;m at work, just finishing up my lunch period, and I&#39;m really wishing I had access to my Ubuntu machine right now. The reason? I just put in a CD of 200 images - one of my backup CDs - and was hoping to get a quick glance at what images were contained on the CD. However, Windows was crawling through the thumbnail generation. Adobe Bridge isn&#39;t much faster (but is what I ended up going with).

Find out more at www.dotnetblogengine.net/ Now that 1.1 has been released, I&#39;m going to be actively looking at theme creation; I&#39;ve got mine, of course, but I&#39;ve got some ideas for others as well.

                                A space ship launches, and while in space, it explodes. Let us assume we can see all possible reasons it could have exploded, and we find that there is an equal chance for one of two components to fail, which therefore would have caused the explosion. In either case, the end result would have been the same, down to the smallest particle. In other words, not even a god could discern any difference between the conclusion of the explosion; everything is exactly in the same place in either case.

                                I&#39;ve almost completed converting the WordPress theme to a BlogEngine.NET theme. The only hard part is when BlogEngine.NET (or ASP.NET) restricts write access to the CSS file. In these cases I have to tweak the CSS file using Firebug. It&#39;s a bit of a chore, since BlogEngine.NET compresses the CSS file so much (which is a good thing, in the long term), but since I&#39;m also changing the file locally in Dreamweaver, it&#39;s just a matter of copying and pasting (over the Firebug CSS content).

                                With a new host, comes a unique move. Previously I was using WordPress, since I was hosted on a Linux (shared) server. Fortunately, I&#39;ve decided to move to a Windows VPS, since the month of June was full of either slow down, or completely down, times. Since I don&#39;t want to install PHP and MySQL (which I would want to pay for the external dbs anyway), I&#39;ve decided to switch my content out of WordPress.

                                After a good number of years, I&#39;ve finally got new glasses ... I don&#39;t know how long I&#39;ve had my previous frames, but I believe I put two different lenses into them. Part of the reason is I don&#39;t care too much about my glasses - I just want glasses that work. So, I went to Lenscrafters and worked with Candace (sp?), and with some assistance from my sister, I picked up two pairs; one pair of regular, and one pair of sunglasses.

                                The following thoughts are from approximately 10:20 last night. While I&#39;d like to believe that technology is good, part of me believes the opposite. So close are they, in fact, that I can make no decision one way or another, try as I might. While it&#39;s true science can heal us, all too often life itself is placed above the reason for life - the reason to live. True, we will soon be living longer and longer, but at what price?

                                This weekend we went down to the Capitol for Madison&#39;s farmer&#39;s market on the square. While walking towards the square (the streets surrounding the Capitol building) I overheard a glimpse of a man&#39;s speech. While I only heard part of, and I have no idea what was going on before or after the conversation, it sounded quite like a monologue. The gist of his speech was that there&#39;s a fight to give illegal immigrants legal status in America.

                                With over 6 hours left of instant watching time left, all that needs to be used before the 10th of the month, it was time for another movie ... This time it was the 2004 film Parasite Dolls. I knew nothing of the film before I watched it. In this anime adventure, androids with knock-out bodies and personalities have begun to take over every area of society. Known as Boomers, these stellar-looking beings begin to show that some are as un-human as you can get, and when their infiltration becomes too much to take, peacekeeper Branch must step in to make things right.

                                I watched Dominion Tank Police this evening, from Netflix. It&#39;s four acts, each consisting of about 35 to 40 minutes of movie (which includes approximately 1 1/2 minutes of opening and ending credits. What really attracted me to the movie was Masamune Shirow, who created not only this series, but also Appleseed (the newer one is more interesting than the original), Black Magic M-66 (which I haven&#39;t yet seen) and Ghost in the Shell (great movies and interesting shows).

                                ... I&#39;m not an Ubuntu-only user yet (unlike some people I know).&nbsp; Granted, I like using it, since I&#39;ve believed, for some time, that if you want to run Apache, you can&#39;t really run it on Windows ... (Granted, I&#39;m having a really difficult time trying to stick to my guns with Apache, versus IIS, but ... well, more on that in the future.) I will probably blow this current box away and re-install Ubuntu, without the Windows partition, and doing a lot more building from source, for example, for Firefox.

All code from a terminal, unless otherwise noted. sudo apt-get install build-essential cd mkdir src cd src I downloaded zlib from http://www.zlib.net/ (zlib source code, version 1.2.3, tar.gz format) into the src folder, and extracted it to the same. cd zlib-1.2.3/ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local make sudo make install At http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi, I downloaded Unix Source: httpd-2.2.4.tar.gz, saved it to the src directory, and extracted it to the same.

I don&#39;t have much desire to update from the repositories all the time, for whatever reason. Supposedly, if you run Eclipse from the download manager on Ubuntu, you can expect one slow experience.  So &hellip; time to start by installing Sun&#39;s Java.</p>

Logically speaking, the rule of Double Negation tells us that p :: ~~p. In order words, if something is blue, it is not not blue. Unfortunately, this is one of the <a href="http://words.strivinglife.com/words/post/Rules-for-Sentential-Logic.aspx">rules for sentential logic</a> that is philosophically troubling.</p>

                                Review for Sin: The Movie (1999); given 2 of 5 stars. These characters were completely new to me (at least, from what I can recall). Needing to burn some &lsquo;Watch Now&rsquo; time, I decided to give this a look, and was quite disappointed (even though I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much). After 15 minutes, I was ready to quit, but I figured it couldn&rsquo;t get any more confusing and decided to stick with it; I should have stopped.

I just finished watching Perfect Blue online (via Netflix). Believing that they do influence what movies are recommended, in a good way, I had to give it four stars, out of five. In Netflix terms, that&#39;s the difference between a &quot;Really Liked It&quot; and a &quot;Loved It.&quot; However, I really wanted to give it a five stars &hellip;</p>

This past Friday, I installed Ubuntu 6.06, upgraded it to 6.10, upgraded it to 7.04. I didn&#39;t have too much time to actually use it this weekend, but I&#39;m beginning to, attempting to move towards using it almost exclusively for day-to-day stuff.</p>

After a bit of looking around, for the best gallery application, I&#39;ve settled on SlideShowPro. While it does require Flash (version 7 or higher, but I&#39;m requiring version 8 or higher for mine), and it did cost some money, it&#39;s a great little application.</p>

    &ldquo;These wars, famines, floods and quakes meet well-defined needs. Man wants chaos. In fact, he&rsquo;s gotta have it. Depression, strife, riots, murder, all this dread. We&rsquo;re irresistibly drawn to that almost orgiastic state created out of death and destruction. It&rsquo;s in all of us. We revel in it. Sure, the media tries to put a sad face on these things, painting them up as great human tragedies. But we all know the function of the media has never been to eliminate the evils of the world, no. Their job is to persuade us to accept those evils and get used to living with them. The powers that be want us to be passive observers.&rdquo; - <cite><a href="http://strivinglife.net/wordpress/2006/05/25/91/waking-life-chapter-4-alienation/">Waking Life</a></cite>

Unfortunately, I haven&rsquo;t kept up all that much with the recent (April 17, 2007) shootings in Virginia. However, I&rsquo;ve seen and heard a disturbing trend, namely the dehumanizing and ostracizing of the shooter, Cho Seung-Hui. Quite frankly, this is disturbing.

I noticed the other day that after upgrading to WordPress 2.1.2, many of the ads that the AdSense-Deluxe plugin was adding were not getting really getting added.

<p>
Normally I add the necessary AdSense-Deluxe (ASD) code immediately after the &#39;more&#39; comment. However, if I changed the location of the ASD code, the ads displayed correctly. Eh?</p>

I frequently find myself in an argument that to many appears to be one of splitting hairs. That is the discussion of atheism, that I am atheist, not AN atheist.

In February 2006, I wrote an <a href="http://strivinglife.net/wordpress/2006/02/16/45/installing-apache-to-a-windows-based-computer-locally/">article covering the installation of Apache 1.3.34</a>, which can be found on my site, StrivingLife.net. In August 2006, I covered <a href="http://strivinglife.net/wordpress/2006/08/22/198/installing-apache-2059-to-a-windows-based-computer-locally-part-1/">the installation of Apache 2.0.59</a>. This time, I&#39;ll be covering the installation of the current version of Apache 2.2.x, Apache 2.2.4, to a Windows XP machine, for the purpose of local development.
</p>
<p>
While I&#39;ll be covering an installation of Apache 2.2.4 that will work along with Apache 1.3.x and Apache 2.0.x, this guide will work equally well if you&#39;re installing Apache 2.2.x by itself.

From the looks of the various sites I&#39;ve checked, it doesn&#39;t appear that much happened, on a large scale, with the recent change of DST.</p>

I was reading an article the other day, which was discussing a companies backup plan. It&#39;s suicidal for companies, in this day and age, <em>not</em> to have some kind of backup plan in place (and, most importantly, tested). Yet, for home users, especially those with important documents on their computers, it&#39;s almost approaching suicidal.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s ways to do these backups by burning to CD or DVD, of course, and even Windows seems to have something built in (or at least my HP computer with a DVD-burner does), but you actually have to run the utility, and put a disc in the drive.</p>

If you listen to the news media, salmonella outbreaks are on a rampage. Spinach, cantaloupe, and now peanut butter. Unfortunately, the cause of these isn&#39;t being investigated successfully. The cause, and on Prince Harry:</p>

The first was written in 1818, the second in 1844, and the third in 1859.</p>
<p>Today I'll be looking at the preface of each of the three editions, and providing an analysis of what he has attempted to get across within each.</p>

WordPress 2.1 was released today and, unfortunately, I&#39;m just not horribly impressed by the new feature list.&nbsp; Granted, it&#39;s a short feature list, but I see few reasons to upgrade.&nbsp; The main reason?&nbsp; Most of these features look like they&#39;re geared towards non-technical/shared-hosting users.</p>

After a number of Google searches, I&#39;ve been unable to find a listing of what browsers support what versions of JavaScript.  The few sites I did find were AnyBrowser.com and Mozilla.org.  Unfortunately, the information they provide is pretty focused.  In this article I&#39;ll be going over this information, and trying to dig up more.</p>

There&#39;s a number of problems with WordPress, as far as accessibility goes.  However, the easiest one to fix is the problem with the calendar, which displays in the default theme, as well as many custom ones (I&#39;m sure).  It lacks a summary tag.</p>

                                I thought Google SketchUp had been released for public consumption before, but ... Google SketchUp 6 is available in both a free, as well as a pay Pro version, and it&#39;s quite impressive. Having played with other tools, like Rhino3D, this is significantly easier, but seemingly on-par, at least for rectangular objects. Go to http://sketchup.google.com/ for more information. While you&#39;re there, take a look at the number of bonus packs available, all of which are seemingly free.

                                There&#39;s a handful of guides out there that list the available loot in Final Fantasy XII (for the Playstation 2). However, none of the ones that I&#39;ve seen collect the information in a form that&#39;s both printer friendly, and in a format that makes checking things off simple. To that effect, I&#39;ve created a five page PDF that allows you to easily check of the number of loot you&#39;ve sold, and what you&#39;ve left to find.

First, DMOZ anyone?&nbsp; Want your site to show up high in the DMOZ directory?

                                Development on Planetside Software&#39;s Terragen&amp;trade; has been extremely slow in the last couple of years.&nbsp; While new versions and news were coming out at a semi-steady pace years ago, visible development dried up. All that changes on December 15 (possibly) with the release of the Terragen 2 Technology Preview.&nbsp; It&#39;s almost 7:30 CST, which means December 16 in a number of parts of the world, and there&#39;s no sign of the download yet.&nbsp; The fact that there&#39;s no mention of what time, makes me think that the Preview still needs/needed a few more touches before it was released.&nbsp; Or, they just want to do some load testing on their servers.&nbsp; Your call.

                                The short stick: New to Ajax? You may want to look elsewhere ... I&#39;ve been working on the Web for a handful+ of years, but save for a brief stunt back in the late 90s, I haven&#39;t had much use for JavaScript (with the exception of a few one/two-liners). As such, I came to this book as a new-comer to Ajax. I also like to learn by way of example, instead of explanation, so code examples are a big plus, if not a requirement.

                                For the past couple days I&#39;ve noticed a rash of fake user account&#39;s being created.&nbsp; I wonder if this isn&#39;t meant to be some new way to possibly exploit WordPress. I&#39;ve kept the original emails I received from WordPress, and am very tempted to delete the accounts.&nbsp; However, WordPress only seems to allow the deletion of accounts.&nbsp; What if I want to &#39;ban&#39; an account/username/email? I suppose I&#39;ll have to go find a plugin, or build one myself.

For a limited time, you too can try Netflix for free.&nbsp; Go to www.netflix.com and enter the code of Friend63.&nbsp; This offer expires on June 30, 2006, but I do hope that means June 2007 ...

                                There&#39;s a very cool interactive map for the University of Wisconsin Madison campus. You can see it at map.wisc.edu. In other news, hopefully I&#39;ll have some photos of my new car, a 2007 VW Rabbit that was built just for me.&nbsp; My previous car was a 1987 VW Golf, which makes my new car 20 years newer.&nbsp; Not too bad for my second car. With just a little luck (not very much at all), the Rabbit should last 20 years as well.

                                <p><p>In this article, we&rsquo;ll be upgrading PHP on our local, Windows, Web server. In previous guides we installed PHP 4.4.2 as well as PHP 5.1.4, both on the same machine, with the ability to switch as we like. However, we&rsquo;ve yet to cover how to upgrade either installation (and upgrading is definitely a need).</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, the current versions of PHP are 4.4.4 and 5.2.0, for the 4.x and 5.x versions, respectively.</p>

This time, we'll be looking at phpBB. &ldquo;phpBB is a high powered, fully scalable, and highly customizable Open Source bulletin board package. phpBB has a user-friendly interface, simple and straightforward administration panel, and helpful FAQ. Based on the powerful PHP server language and your choice of MySQL, MS-SQL, PostgreSQL or Access/ODBC database servers, phpBB is the ideal free community solution for all web sites.&rdquo; Lot's of features, so let's get to it.

Almost there. This time, we&#39;ll be looking at <a href="http://www.punbb.org/">PunBB</a>. First, I did donate to PunBB development some time ago. At the time, I liked PunBB, and received some great support. It&#39;s been sometime since that time, so I don&#39;t know how things stand.
</p>
<p>
Anywho, &ldquo;PunBB is a fast and lightweight PHP-powered discussion board. It is released under the GNU General Public License. Its primary goals are to be faster, smaller and less graphically intensive as compared to other discussion boards. PunBB has fewer features than many other discussion boards, but is generally faster and outputs smaller, semantically correct XHTML-compliant pages.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
In this article, we&#39;ll be installing PunBB version 1.2.14, which is the latest version, as of October 15, 2006.

Curiously, in late-September 2006, <a href="http://simplemachines.org/">Simple Machines Forum</a> turned three (it had been three years since 1.0 beta 1). That&#39;s curious because the current stable version of Simple Machines is 1.0.9, and there&#39;s a 1.1 RC3 out as well (as of late-October 2006).
</p>
<p>
In this article, we&#39;ll be installing Simple Machines version 1.0.9, so we can compare it to the other PHP forums that we&#39;ve installed, or will be installing.

A relative new-comer, <a href="http://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a> &ldquo;is forum software with a twist from the creators of WordPress&rdquo;. The first public version, 0.72, was released in mid-October 2006, and the version we&#39;ll be installing, 0.73, was released a couple of weeks later. Downloading bbPress is fairly easy, since there&#39;s only two options &ndash; one for the installer in .zip, and one in .tar.gz.

                                First, is good to see Doyle re-elected.&nbsp; Related to this, thanks to Gavin for the information he provides on Green. Second, it&#39;s unfortunate that Wisconsin has decided to make a constitutional amendment to &quot;provide that only a marriage between one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state and that a legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals shall not be valid or recognized in this state.&quot; Third, it&#39;s good to see some potential balance in Washington.&nbsp; One party can lead us deep into the deserts, if we&#39;re not very careful, and loud.

Quick review. I liked Cowboy Bebop, and I believe this was recommended from Amazon (for those who like Cowboy Bebop). Instead of purchasing the complete collection of Outlaw Star, I decided to try out one of the discs, containing the first five episodes, from Netflix.</p>

                                Earlier today I ran across an article titled &quot;IE7 vs. FireFox: Why Microsoft Lost the Battle,&quot; which stated at the end that &quot;All in all, IE evolution is not impressive at all. It will still have one advantage though: after installing/reinstalling XP or Vista, IE7 will be the first and only browser used to download Opera, BonEcho or FireFox&hellip;&quot; Unfortunately, this article, as well as the numerous other articles that state that Microsoft&#39;s IE 7 is &#39;too little, too late,&#39; are way off base, which is quite the good thing.

I&#39;ve been trying to get a pretty good range of movies through Netflix.  While it wasn&#39;t high on my list of movies that I wanted to see, it was a documentary, and therefore a good genre to put into the mix every once in a while.  While I&#39;m giving the movie three stars, I thought it was worthwhile to watch, but don&#39;t think I&#39;d sit through another viewing.</p>

Since I&#39;m not going to be able to write the article(s) that I wanted to tonight (since one is going to require research, and the other is going to involve thought) I figure I&#39;ll write up a quick review on The Departed, which I had the pleasure of seeing today.</p>

                                While it&#39;s true I probably should have watched 2001: A Space Odyssey a long time ago, I&#39;ve just gotten around to watching it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, perhaps I should have watched it sooner and have been done with it. While visually stunning, I&#39;m having a hard time finding any substance behind the movie that I can really grasp.&nbsp; All-in-all, I&#39;ve given 2001: A Space Odyssey a generous three stars, since while I&#39;m sure it was amazing when it first came out, it&#39;s, I hate to say it, kind of boring.

                                In Gavin Schmitt&#39;s 2006 essay Should We Examine Life?, Gavin attempts to arrive at some solid decision on the two following questions, &quot;Is there value in examining our lives and the world around us? Is there value in ignoring our selves and our world?&quot;, having come to this questions based upon Socrates&#39; claim that &quot;the unexamined life is not worth living&quot;. However, while Gavin attempts to answer these questions, and perhaps succeeds, he opens himself up to an even larger question, which will be the topic of this essay.

                                For many years, North by Northwest is a movie that I have wanted to see, if not consciously, then certainly at the back of my mind.&nbsp; Other than the somewhat sappy ending, North by Northwest was one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen in a very long time. Directed by Hitchcock, this movie truly put me on the edge of my seat.&nbsp; The ending was quite a surprise, and the movie has aged extremely well in the over 40 years since it&#39;s release.&nbsp; Not only that, but Cary Grant truly shines in this movie, from beginning to end, truly an actor that others should aspire to beat.

Grave of the Fireflies is a fairly (read: very) depressing story.  Supposedly, this film was named Best Animated Feature at a children&#39;s festival, yet I don&#39;t know that the intended audience is children.  Nonetheless, even though it&#39;s depressing, I think it&#39;s a good film, showing the hardships some people (have) face(d).</p>

There are a number of movies out there that seem like they go on far longer than one would have thought.  Two hours long, but it feels like it&#39;s over four.  Ran is one of these movies, but in the best possible light.</p>

The first thing to always keep in mind, while watching any documentary, is that the producers always have an agenda in mind.  That said, this is the second Michael Moore film I&#39;ve seen (Fahrenheit <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> being the other), and the time I&#39;ve reminded myself to take everything with a grain of salt.</p>

I&#39;ve wanted to watch the debate for some time, so, after the one on Friday, I decided it was time to take a look for some video.  I did find a copy of the first one, from WisPolitics.com, so here&#39;s my comments on the debate.
</p>
<p>
Disclaimer: Thanks to <a href="http://framingbusiness.net/">Gavin</a>, I know Green is a jerk.  If you live in Wisconsin, and you watch TV, you&#39;ve probably also seen Green&#39;s ads, where he likes to attack Doyle, even though Doyle is running pretty nice ads.  So, full disclosure, I&#39;ll be voting for Doyle this year, and I hope my fellow Wisconsin citizens will as well.</p>

                                Duh. Unfortunately, much like Google Video, you can get sucked into the program and end up spending hours (2 and a half in my case) goofing around, getting nothing of real value done. Of course, that begs the question of whether experience, as experience, is of any value. Do we, simply by experiencing, benefit? I suppose when it comes to use a technology, like Photoshop, any experience is a good experience.

At their best, the Japanese are one of the few groups that can create, again and again, movies that touch upon great philosophical questions and ideas.  Urusei Yatsura Movie 2: Beautiful Dreamer, is one of those great philosophical movies that you could watch again, just for the dialogue.</p>

                                So, the Isthmus picked up my post on Netflix.&nbsp; That&#39;s very nice of them (I wonder how it was picked up?).&nbsp; In the course of looking over the Isthmus&#39; site, I noticed another post title &quot;Dear City of Madison&quot; Ouch. Reading his post first, and his profile second (which included his location), the title of this post came to mind. Years ago, when both my sister and I were living at home, we&#39;d fight, as siblings under one roof and with only one TV, often do.&nbsp; Her time would be spent surfing around, from one channel to another.&nbsp; As we got older, and we were both able to drive, she took that habit with her to the car and the radio.&nbsp; (Thankfully, I&#39;m older, so I never picked up her horrid habits.) Anywho, Rad&#39;s post reminded me of my sister, and what I told her many times, about surfing through radio stations.&nbsp; At first it was long, but as time passed, and my words had no impact on her, it shortened up.&nbsp; To sum, &quot;If you keep channel surfing, you&#39;re bound to keep running into commercials.&quot;&nbsp; Id est, you&#39;re bound to keep running up against crap.&nbsp; Sure, everyonce in a while you&#39;ll hit something good, but your chances of listening to the entire song are slim.&nbsp; Only by picking a station and sticking with it are you truly able to determine whether the station is any good.

Yesterday, I did multiple takes for a video on how to create snippets in Dreamweaver 8. The video ended up being pretty good, I think, albeit the video size was a bit large, and the resolution was a bit small (640x480 is what Google recommends).</p>

                                There's a reason PHP and Apache are so popular on the Web. It's the same reason that most beginner's, especially those that have no formal training, start with these technologies. In a word, both technologies are not only open source, but free to use. With the right guide, a user can be up and running with Apache and PHP in a couple of hours. Unfortunately, Microsoft's IIS (Internet Information Services) is something that few home-grown Web users have the honour of using.

                                The Subversion aspect has been updated for Windows Vista.&nbsp;So too has the TortoiseSVN installation. The&nbsp;Dreamweaver&nbsp;aspect has not been touched. I also have an article about using Subversion.&nbsp; When projects become large, or you have the need to keep information on what files you&rsquo;ve modified, for any coding project, you may look for some kind of version control system. There&rsquo;s software like Microsoft&rsquo;s SourceSafe, but that can be costly, and according to some, it&rsquo;s a clunky solution.

                                Firefox 1.5.0.7 was released today.&nbsp; Once again, I found out about this by seeing a site mention it, instead of my browser notifying me ... Ah well.&nbsp; It&#39;s recommended that you download, so go do it!&nbsp; Note that the partial download failed for me.&nbsp; Firefox actually had to download a 6.1 MB file to update Firefox, instead of the under 600 KB file it initially downloaded.&nbsp; While I was at it, I checked my Extensions for updates, which I also recommend you do as well.

                                Version control is something that I've been interested in for the past several months (actually, what month is it, September? I guess it's been longer than just a couple of months) but that I haven't been able to dig into as much as I'd like. Subversion keeps coming up as a good piece of software, with the addition of Trac. Since I wrote the guide to installing Apache 2.0.x a bit ago, I have no reason for not getting started with Subversion.

I&#39;ll be needing to get a new Playstation 2 memory card shortly, since the I&#39;ve got less than a MB left on each of the two cards I currently have. While there&#39;s some extra Final Fantasy X saves that I could go through and delete, I&#39;d really like to backup the saves that I have to my computer.

                                I&#39;ve spent the last couple of hours trying to get Dreamweaver 8 to begin to function as a MXML IDE. Unfortunately, while I can get every &lt;mx: tag added to the code hints, I&#39;m having a heck of a time getting the actual code hints to function. The small tutorial that Macromedia (and truly it was Macromedia at the time) provided isn&#39;t very helpful at all. CodeSnipers.com (link below) has some information on using Dreamweaver 8 a Ruby IDE, but since Ruby appears to be so function based ...

                                Near the top of one of the sections in the POV-Ray&trade; 3.5 manual there is a quote about wishing that past mathematical formulas were remembered, or something to that effect. I too wish I had remembered what I had learned in some of my past math classes, but after a bit of research, I have begun to work on some of the information that I have forgotten. Here is one of those areas.

                                In the previous three parts of this guide, we setup Apache 2.0.59 and then created the necessary connections to use ActivePerl, mod_perl, ColdFusion MX 6.1, ColdFusion MX 7.0.2, PHP 4.4.2, PHP 5.1.4, MySQL 4.1.18, and PostgreSQL 8.1.3. This time, we're going to bring everything together by creating a number of batch files to fairly easily switch between various Web server setups. What is a batch file? A batch file is basically a way to run a number of Windows prompts at once.

                                In Part 1 of this Apache 2.0.59 guide, we setup Apache 2.0.59 on a Windows XP SP2 machine. We also setup Perl and mod_perl, attempting to mimic our Apache 1.3.34 install. In Part 2 of this Apache 2.0.59 guide, we setup ColdFusion MX 6.1 and 7.0. This time, we'll be continuing in our quest by adding support for both PHP 4 and PHP 5. In previous guides, we installed PHP 4 and PHP 5, so if you need to install either one, do so with the above directions.

                                In a previous article, I described how to install Apache 1.3.34 to an average home computer, running Windows XP. Since then, only Apache 1.3.35 has been released that would allow me to update my guide, even though the current 1.3.x version is 1.3.37. There&#39;s also a desire on my part to use Apache 2.0, even though my host has not yet begun using them. For that reason, I&#39;ll be walking through a second installation of Apache on a home computer, so that both Apache 1.3.x and Apache 2.0.x can run together (if not at the same time, then at least switchable, as I detailed how to do with PHP).

                                &quot;&#39;Tis always better to be who you are, then to strive after who you may have been.&quot; Which is to say, if you ever have the chance to go back and change certain events in your past (as in, time travel), do not take it. The you that you could now be is not the you that you have become. In fact, the you that you may have become may be worse off than the you that you are, no matter what you may now believe.

(Togusa:) &quot;Are we actually back in physical reality?&quot;

<p>
(Batou:) &quot;There is no way to distinguish reminiscence from true memory. Whatever they are, they can only be analyzed after the fact. The passage of time itself can&#39;t be stored, so it&#39;s tough. And inevitable, now that our e-brains share external memories. Do your wife and daughter, waiting for you at home, really exist? Or are you, in reality, still single, living in some cheap rented room, only dreaming of that family. Don&#39;t you want to verify what actually happened back there?&quot;

&quot;He used to be a long-range military scout. &#39;Unfit as a commander, unfit to be commanded, fit only to languish by the wayside.&#39; He bounced around between Special Forces and Electronics, and got into black market weapons. His reputation turned to shit. Wound up your garden-variety hacker.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Sounds like quite a story.&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Yeah, but no matter how far a jackass travels, it won&#39;t come back a horse. His downfall came when his reach exceeded his grasp. Let&#39;s go.&quot;

&quot;This area was once intended as the Fear East&#39;s most important information center, a Special Economic Zone in its heyday. These towers survive as a shadow of the city&#39;s former glory. Its dubious sovereignty has made it the ideal haven for multi-nationals and the criminal elements that feed off their spoils. It&#39;s a lawless zone, beyond the reach of UN or E-police. Reminds me of the line, &#39;What the body creates, is as much an expression of DNA as the body itself.&#39;&quot;

In other words, Eclipse is an open source editor capable of helping you write the necessary code for a number of programming languages.

                                On CNET this morning I ran across Speedtest.net.&nbsp; Like sites and tools that have come before it, it&#39;s meant to test connection speeds between one computer and another.&nbsp; Unlike previous ones, however, the UI is much more attactive (i.e., more Web 2.0-like). If you haven&#39;t tried it out yet, I recommend you do so.&nbsp; My results from Charter, in Madison WI, are below. It&#39;ll be interesting to see just how long this stays up.&nbsp; It&#39;s been Dugg and /.&#39;d, and it&#39;s still giving fairly accurate numbers.&nbsp; But, can the site stay up with just AdSense?&nbsp; What are their costs?

&quot;Already this week, we&#39;ve had eight cases of gynoids murdering their masters. After each killing, they self-destruct, electronic brains reformatted. In each case, the model in question is Locus Solus #2052, &quot;Hadaly&quot; type. A prototype developed for testing, they were provided free of charge to contractors. Now, they&#39;ve recalled all the prototypes. According to their most recent report, they&#39;ve identified no defects in either software or hardware.&quot;

In a future time, when most human thought has been accelerated by artificial intelligence and external memory can be shared on a universal matrix, Batou, an agent of the elite Section 9 Security Force and a begin so artificially modified as to be essentially cyborg, is assigned, along with his mostly human partner, Togusa, to investigage a series of gruesome murders.
</p>
<p>
Time has passed since Batou&#39;s original partner, Major Motoko Kusanagi, cybernetically enhanced to such a degree that only her &quot;ghost&quot; remained human, disappeared into the Net. Since then, Batou has wondered where her ghost might be and if the Major will ever return ...

<p>I do not speak, nor understand, Japanese, so this is an American-version transcript. Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence is an extremely philosophical movie, so I have decided to watch and type up a transcript of the movie so that I could expand my own knowledge of the film. In the spirit of the Internet/Web, I provide it here as well to aid others.</p>

I just figured out a problem I was having connecting to the Internet yesterday, so today it&#39;s been browsing browsing browsing.

I also just grabbed last month&#39;s stats (from AWStats) for my site, and hooked up Google Analytics (having grabbed an invite from the Digital Point forums - to quote Gavin, &quot;woot&quot;).  Looking at browser stats in particular (from AWStats - Analytics won&#39;t be functional until tomorrow), I noticed a couple of things.</p>

                                In previous guides, we installed PHP 4.4.2 and later moved our installation to a different folder. This time, we'll be installing the current release of PHP 5 (5.1.4) so that we can still switch back to PHP 4.4.2 if we'd like. Downloading PHP 5.x The current version of PHP 5.x is 5.1.4, so we'll begin by downloading that from PHP.net. We&rsquo;ll want to download the (Windows Binaries) zip file, even though it is significantly larger in size than the installer (the zip file is almost 9 MB, compared to less than 3 MB for the executable), but allows us a deal more flexibility.

This last weekend I watched A Scanner Darkly, which had just hit a local Madison theatre on Friday.  I&#39;d been looking forward to the film since I&#39;d heard about it, and since it promised to showcase a look like <a href="http://strivinglife.com/waking-life-transcript-with-revisions/">Waking Life</a>.</p>

In this guide, we&#39;ll be leaving our installation of ColdFusion MX 6.1, and upgrading our installation of ColdFusion MX 7.0.1 to 7.0.2. Downloading the updater ColdFusion MX 7.0.2 can either be downloaded as a full installer, or as a simple updater. Since we&#39;ve already installed 7.0.1, we can just use the updater. Go to http://www.adobe.com/support/coldfusion/downloads_updates.html and download the current updater, ColdFusion MX 7 Updater 2 (7.0.2) for Windows.

                                In this article, we&#39;ll be moving our installation of PHP 4.4.2 from c:\php\ to c:\php4\. We&#39;ll be doing this primarily because we may like the ability to run multiple versions of PHP at one time, on our development server. This will pave the way for our future installation of PHP 5.1.4 (or the current version of PHP 5.x). The added benefit is that we&#39;ll have an idea of just how many documents are involved in a relatively simple change.

What bothers me is that now that I&#39;ve seen the movie, I want to donate - I want to write, etcetera - but where&#39;s the call to action?&nbsp; Turns out it&#39;s at www.climatecrisis.net By filling out just a couple of forms, you can send a message to your representatives.

We did this so that we would have an easy way to administer our MySQL databases, from a PHP-based interface. This time, we&#39;ll be upgrading phpMyAdmin to version 2.8.1.

For the past hour, I&#39;ve been looking at current ways to get my name out there for Web page cleanup and commenting.  In other words, I&#39;d like to work with existing code to bring it closer to the standards, and comment it, if necessary.  I would think it would be of great benefit to those individuals who bought a solution from a vendor, and are looking at changes to that code, or cleanup so that there pages act alike in most browsers.  Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t found a site to offer my wares.  I&#39;ve also looked at open source projects that may need some free help, but, alas, nothing there either.</p>

                                In a previous guide, we installed Zend Optimizer 2.6.2 to a local Windows-based Apache 1.x server, running PHP 4.4.2. This time, we'll be upgrading Zend Optimizer from 2.6.2 to 3.0.1. Downloading and backups First, we'll need to download a copy from http://www.zend.com/products/zend_optimizer/. We've already setup an account when we downloaded 2.6.2, so we can simply log in. Of course, if you've forgotten your password you can request assistance, and if you haven't downloaded Zend Optimizer before, you can setup an account.

Some time ago, I purchased a Wacom Graphire (the larger 6 x 8 model) direct from Wacom (since the local shops either didn&#39;t carry or were sold out).  Since then, I&#39;ve completed two surveys and received two DVDs from the <a href="http://www.digitalinnovator.com/">Digital Innovator</a> series.</p>

When it comes to proper coding, you should know the most important rule of all; LIFO. However, not even LIFO nor the W3C can really tell you which order to put certain elements. In the nature of Web 2.0, I&#39;ll discuss some of the standards I&#39;ve been bouncing around for HTML text markup when the same text is given multiple attributes.

                                In a previous guide, we walked through installing ActivePerl on a local machine. This time, we'll be upgrading ActivePerl. For this guide, we'll be upgrading from ActivePerl 5.8.7.815 to 5.8.8.817. However, since the installation requires the uninstallation of previous versions of ActivePerl, we'll simply be installing a new version of ActivePerl. If you have not installed Perl before, you can skip ahead to "Installing Perl" below. Please note that this guide will work equally well for the installation of, or upgrade to, ActivePerl 5.8.8.819.

We had some minor-major flooding on my house&#39;s closest intersection.  Three cars got stuck - mid-sized vehicles like a Toyota Avalon (?).  All three got pushed out of the water, but all three weren&#39;t turning over any more.  Tomorrow morning I&#39;ll know how bad mine is.</p>

My first shot at installing Debian didn&#39;t go quite so well.  I&#39;m attempting to install on a HP Pavilion XE734, using pretty much the base system.  One addition appears to be a 3Com Fast Etherlink PCI card, from the late 90s &hellip; (3C595-TX).</p>

My birthday happens to be today, and when I started checking my email this morning, I was presented with 4 different birthday greetings, from 4 different forums.  I&#39;m aware that forums have been doing this for a long time, so what struck me is the forums I signed up for, but don&#39;t remember doing so :D  (That&#39;s also a little security-scary<sup><a id="link1" name="link1" href="#note1" title="link1">1</a></sup>, but I know I&#39;m signed up with many more that don&#39;t appear to be sending birthday greetings.)</p>

I can remember when we bought an Atari.  It was a used machine, and had a number of games, including the very great Berserker.  That&#39;s actually the only game I can really remember, other than the impossible E.T.  After that, at some point, came a NES.  Unlike the Atari, we had one game to start with - Mario and Duck Hunt.</p>

I&#39;ve just updated The Framing Business to work with WordPress. While doing so, I decided to take a close look at just how AdSense is working on that site, compared to just this blog. What I found was actually quite surprising.</p>

One of the most commonly used hooks in scary stories is the idea that the main character is deceased, but doesn&#39;t know it.  As soon as I read the description for the movie The House of the Dead, I pictured the three young boys from Tales from the Hood (1995) and Clarence Williams III (all-around great actor for this genre - see also his role in Miami Vice (in season one or two)).</p>

                                According to some people, the keywords meta tag has more relevancy/use than the description meta tag. Unfortunately, this is dead wrong. As I&#39;ve been able to prove (for myself, at least) this last month, the meta description is quite alive and well. Why people think it&#39;s not only dead, but surpassed by the meta keywords (!!!), I&#39;ll never understand. (And, by the way, these were August &#39;05, January &#39;06 articles/posts.) After looking for a good plug-in, I decided to work on something that was a) easier and b) easier.

                                Thanks to some great service yesterday, I&#39;ve successfully logged into my Vault again, and am seeing actual data. I have a day and a half of data, but I&#39;m already quite impressed with the user interface. I&#39;m also extremely impressed by the feedback I&#39;ve received from individuals involved in the project. This is definitely something that I&#39;m looking forward to seeing how it develops in the near future. They&#39;ve definitely hit on something big.

Just for purchasing a discount card at a local video store (GameStop), I not only got a year of 10% off video games, I also picked up a free one-year subscription to <cite>Game Informer</cite>.  Not too bad for $15.  In this month&#39;s issue, Issue 157 (May 2006), there&#39;s a page of debate (yes and no) to the question of whether or not in-game advertising really hurts video games.  In this post, I&#39;ll be looking at the two responses, as well as crafting my own response to this question.</p>

                                Last night, I was working through a great tutorial that steps through how to create a basic XML parser in PHP. Unfortunately, what I was going to use it for (a local Attention Recorder parser) isn't going to be possible, since the extension's XML isn't quite valid. I was hoping to at least get /ROOT Vaults to work today, in that case, but no dice on support.&nbsp; So, I'll be attempting to reset my password once again, in the hope that it was just a two day problem ...

                                If my last post got you interested in the AttentionTrust project, and you downloaded the extension, are using it now, and are reading this on StrivingLife.net (whew, lot&#39;s of &#39;if&#39;s), then you may have noticed that StrivingLife.net is now a certified member.&nbsp; What does that mean for you? First, that I agree with four principles that the AttentionTrust organization puts forward; 1. Property : You own your attention and can store it wherever you wish.

Being able to look at the statistics for a couple of different sites, with very different audiences, I&#39;ve found one common thread, which is quite alarming.  Before you go any further, it has to do with bots and search engines, so if you&#39;re not interested in either, you can probably safely skip this post.</p>

                                For the last 10 minutes, while downloading the latest Microsoft patches from Tuesday, I've been trying to access Google Calendar. I'm prompted to login, after a long wait, and then I wait some more, only to be sent to my Google Account page. So, are they limiting access to the Calendar now as well? I like Google - it's the only search engine I use (and it's the engine most people use - for better or worse) - but they need to make sure they can handle the heavy demand's that their launches bring.

Quite a while ago - back in May of 2003 actually - I began work on a guide that would display every possible number combination for cross sum puzzles. Since then, a number of people have corrected mistakes that crept in, resulting in a number of different versions of the guide over the last (almost) two years.</p>

The home page of mod_perl gives a great explanation of what mod_perl is, and what it provides. We&#39;ll be installing mod_perl simply because it will help us install other functionality as time goes by.

                                The wp-shortstat plugin, modified for WordPress 2.x use by Markus Kaemmerer, is a great little plugin. I&#39;ve been using it since March 17, and since Markus has been doing a deal of updating (additional functionality, as well as bug fixes), I&#39;ve been checking it on a regular basis (and have looked through the code more than once). However, since I started out by using 1.3, I&#39;ve got a problem with old records skewing my stats.

As stated in a previous article, there&#39;s a site, <a href="http://blog.html.it/layoutgala/">http://blog.html.it/layoutgala/</a>, that offers free templates.  Using these templates, you can easily create a site, so long as you have the content you need to fill the pages.
</p>
<p>
In this article, we&#39;ll be putting some content into one of these templates, Layout 34, but we can use the methods we discuss here on any of the templates.

This time, we&#39;ll be covering the minimum HTML knowledge required to be truly dangerous. While an expanded understanding of HTML is not, per se, required, having at least some understanding will help in a number of ways. Of course, the more HTML you know, the less you rely on tools to do the work (which is a good thing, since we&#39;re not always able to use the tools that we&#39;re familar with).</p>

                                There&rsquo;s two major topics that come up when you&rsquo;re talking with someone who wants to create a Web site, and they have a number of questions revolving around them. This article will be discussing these two major topics - content and audience - and raise the major questions that must be answered. Content is obviously one of the major topics because that&rsquo;s what a Web site is - the display of content.

                                Alessandro Fulciniti, along with an unnamed number of people, have create 40 CSS-based templates, free for download, available at http://blog.html.it/layoutgala/. They've got near every possible layout that I can think of, along with a number more. Stick on a stylesheet, and you're golden. The only real problem I see is that navigation items should, according to some sources, come before the main content area. After all if the CSS disappears, then you'll still want navigation to come first.

                                For work today, I sent off an email to support for a product that we purchased, FusionReactor (an application for helping analyze/debug ColdFusion). About an hour later, one of their support members called me up and talked me through the answers to the questions I had raised.&nbsp; He also went above and beyond what I had asked by digging deeper into what we were looking for, and even went so far as to suggest that we could send on some log files for them to peruse.

I haven&#39;t had much time to play around with it, obviously, but I&#39;m impressed by the sample layouts they have.  I might actually bounce around a little bit, until I find one that I can make my own.</p>

                                Having already added MySQL support for ColdFusion MX, it's time to look at adding PostgreSQL. For many of the same reasons we installed PostgreSQL with PHP, we'll be doing this to add to our potential resources. However, unlike our connection of MySQL with ColdFusion MX, we'll need to install some additional features to ColdFusion MX. (This guide assumes you've already installed PostgreSQL.) Downloading and installing the JDBC Driver The first thing we'll need to do is install a special driver for ColdFusion.

                                Until now, we've yet to setup a connection to MySQL from ColdFusion MX. This has meant that while we can do cool database things in PHP (like WordPress), we can't in ColdFusion. Until now. This time, we'll be setting up MySQL 4.1.18 and ColdFusion MX 6.1 on our local server. Because of some of the choices that we've made before, this installation is going to be fairly quick. Setting up MySQL database and user First, we'll need to setup a MySQL database and user for ColdFusion.

                                While we've already setup MySQL, another popular SQL server is PostgreSQL. Like MySQL, PostgreSQL is absolutely free, and will allow us to create databases on our local server. Downloading PostgreSQL We'll be downloading the most current version of PostgreSQL, which is 8.1.3 at the time of this writing. You can download the installation file from http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/win32. We'll want to download the regular zip file, called postgresql-8.1.3-1.zip, and weighing in at 21 MB.

This time, we&#39;ll be upgrading WordPress. For this guide, we&#39;ll be upgrading from WordPress 2.0.1 to 2.0.2.  Note that this guide will work equally well for upgrading to 2.0.3, 2.0.4 or 2.0.5.

                                I don&#39;t typically keep track of sports, but since Kirby Puckett was one of my favourite sport&#39;s people when I was younger, I have to at least mention his passing. It&#39;s funny, but now that I bought rabbit ears for the TV, I&#39;ve been actually getting more news than I was before.&nbsp; Unfortunately, and in some ways fortunately, the numbers I&#39;m hearing from the news are quite high.&nbsp; As in over 60% of troops in Iraq want out of Iraq, over 60% don&#39;t have confidence in Bush, and over 60% think civil war in Iraq is likely.

This time, we&#39;ll be installing WordPress onto our local Web server. This installation will require us to work with both PHP and MySQL, and we&#39;ll be able to setup any number of WordPresses after we have completed this one.

In this tutorial, we&#39;ll be working through an installation of ColdFusion MX 6.1, Developer&#39;s Edition, on a local, Windows-based, Apache server. On this server, we&#39;ve setup Apache, PHP, and MySQL, but will also want to have the ability to work with ColdFusion code (however, not necessarily on the same sites that we&#39;ll be using PHP). We&#39;ll be doing this to experience a more corporate Web-programming language &ndash; corporate primarily because of the costs associated with ColdFusion.

                                My intention is to write a number of guides that will help someone build a functional Web server for testing purposes. Since Windows is fairly popular, I've decided to outline how to install Web server programs on it. Since Apache is both powerful and free, I've opted to use it as the core, instead of IIS, or the like. I also plan on keeping the various technologies up-to-date, yet continuing to provide the instructions for past versions used, just in case.

From Zend&#39;s FAQ,
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
    <strong>Why use the Zend Optimizer; isn&#39;t PHP supposed to be quite fast already?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    The standard Zend run-time compiler used by PHP is indeed extremely fast, generating code that is usually 2 to 10 times faster. But an application that uses the Zend Optimizer typically executes another 40% to 100% faster.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, Zend Optimizer will help decrease the time spent on processing code. If you run the file we created a few steps back, probably called <a href="http://localhost/phpinfo.php">http://localhost/phpinfo.php</a> (which basically runs &lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;), you&#39;ll notice a line that says &quot;This program makes use of the Zend Scripting Language Engine: Zend Engine v1.3.0, Copyright &copy; 1998-2004 Zend Technologies&quot;. This is the standard Zend run-time compiler that is mentioned above. Once we download and install the Zend Optimizer, we&#39;ll see some additional lines here.

                                Last time, we successfully installed both MySQL and phpMyAdmin on our local server. However, we only had one user. This time, we'll be installing MySQL Administrator, to give us the ability to add administer MySQL in a way that we can't do with phpMyAdmin. Before we go, please note that the MySQL Administrator does not take away the value of phpMyAdmin. In fact, phpMyAdmin is usually how you'll be able to administer your MySQL databases in the real world.

                                After having seen a blog that did it, I&#39;ve installed a nifty little WordPress plugin that displays word count, image count, and estimated reading time. For some of my articles, the estimated reading time is going to be far off, but ... it&#39;s nifty nonetheless.&nbsp; Reminder - I&#39;ll be posting the &#39;second part&#39; of the MySQL tutorial tonight.

                                Note: This guide should work equally well for phpMyAdmin 2.8.1 and above. For a guide on upgrading this 2.7.0-pl2 install, see Upgrading phpMyAdmin (2.7.0-pl2 to 2.8.1) on a local, Windows-based, Apache server. MySQL will allow us to create databases on our local server. With PHP, this will allow us to install applications like the free WordPress, as well as number of open source content management systems, not to mention bulletin boards and the like.

                                While our previous article walked through adding Perl to our local server, Perl just isn't going to cut it for creating dynamic content. For that, we're going to have to install a more powerful language. As I said quite a few articles ago, if we would have gone the IIS route, we could have the use of ASP. However, since we're going the Apache route, that means PHP is our best choice.

                                Since I've got a couple more days worth of tutorials already written, and since things are now going relatively smoothly (I had a couple of problems with the MySQL implementation as a whole), I figured I would give an update to what I've been doing, and what I will be doing. Tonight, I'll be posting the tutorial on getting PHP up and running.&nbsp; Within a day, or maybe two, of doing that, I'll be walking through the installation of MySQL and phpMyAdmin.&nbsp; The next tutorial will cover MySQL Administrator (and will closely follow the previous posting).

Log files are created by Web sites to track page views and visitors.&nbsp; For example, if we go to a page on one of our local Web sites with Firefox, like http://website.localhost/, it adds the following lines to a file called access.log.

Following our previous tutorial, Installing Apache to a Windows-based computer, locally, we can either dump additional folders in our Apache root, or we can create additional subdomains under localhost.</p>

                                It&#39;s true, at least from news stories currently coming in. RIAA et al. says CD ripping, backups not fair use and RIAA now says ripping is illegal. I think we&#39;re finally getting down to the basic point now.&nbsp; Is file-sharing bad?&nbsp; No (again, as I&#39;ve stressed elsewhere, p2p networks allow the sharing of more than just copyrighted material).&nbsp; Is the RIAA losing money bad?&nbsp; Looks like it. Yeesh.

First off, Gmail accounts are basically a dime-a-dozen these days, but if you&#39;re still looking to pick up an account, I have a number of invites I&#39;d be willing to shed.</p>

Near the end of the January, I talked about installing ColdFusion on my home computer. Starting this week (hopefully), I&#39;ll be writing a number of posts detailing how to go about doing these installations, with the express purpose of creating an environment for the testing of Web pages, or the learning of HTML/PHP/ColdFusion.</p>

Having moved from items written in January of 2006, to items written in late-2005, then to 2001, and then back to mid-2005, I have realized for myself what many have already realized.  There&#39;s a problem with the Internet.</p>

                                In January, looking at the number of pages that were viewed, around 63% of visitors used Internet Explorer to access a page on the StrivingLife.net Network, while 26% used Firefox.&nbsp; After that, about 3.5% used Safari, followed by 2.9% using Mozilla and 2.2% using Opera.&nbsp; Netscape?&nbsp; 1.4%. Of course, the Firefox numbers give it away pretty well - we cater to a more technologically literate group than the Internet as a whole.&nbsp; Of course, the fact that Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0 shows up in statistics as far back as July 2005 points to that as well.

States/governments/masses of people, on the other hand, are/can be. Are you punishing the &#39;terrorists&#39;, or are you punishing the common man in what-so-ever country is determined to be aiding the terrorists, in that some of it&#39;s most popular few are assisting?

I&#39;ll be adding a number of older articles to this area (articles from <a href="http://strivinglife.net/articles/">http://strivinglife.net/articles/</a>) in the interest of creating both a standard, as well as making articles easier to find.  Since they&#39;ll be post-dated (new articles will not, of course), they won&#39;t be crowding out any current posts.</p>

I&#39;m sorry, but I hate it when people use &lt;ul&gt; instead of &lt;blockquote&gt;.  &lt;ul&gt; is for list items, and should therefore be composed of list items (&lt;li&gt;s). If you&#39;re not going to put &lt;li&gt;s for each item within a &lt;ul&gt; block, <strong>don&#39;t use &lt;ul&gt;</strong></p>

So, I guess I lied about the upgrade to WordPress 2.0, as I just finished doing it. Doesn&#39;t look like one of the old plug-ins is going to work yet, but since I don&#39;t use it &hellip;</p>

With the new year, comes a couple of smart technology reminders.  Your computer can&#39;t stay clean by itself - make sure you&#39;re doing your part.  And with the new year, and new month, why not verify things are up-to-date now?</p>

                                I&#39;m looking for ideas on what I can write in PHP and MySQL.&nbsp; Thus far, I&#39;ve written: 1) A comments system, that still gets hit by spam (but don&#39;t they all?). 2) An admin interface to upload documents, then create a record in a database for display elsewhere (along with categories and related articles/documents). I just don&#39;t know - what do I *need* for functionality?&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;ll look further into creating a RSS reader - I just don&#39;t know ...

Thanks to my sister still being in school, I&#39;ve been able to pick up a number of very powerful commercial tools for fairly cheap.  I&#39;m big on free programs - Open Source being the key word these days - but sometimes the professional&#39;s tools are just more than all that.</p>

<p>Description: Notes and comments on Chapter 15 of Bertrand Russell's <em>Problems of Philosophy</em>, sufficiently forming an overview.</p>

<p>Notes: Text comes from the source listed below. Highlighting is my own, as well as any indented text. The best way to use this document is to either read a copy reprinted elsewhere and then to read over this, to read the entire (non-indented) text here, with particular note of the highlighted areas, or to read this entire document, from top to bottom. The notes that I supply follow immediately after a paragraph and discuss/clarify the above paragraph. The highlighting is meant to draw attention to particular words, as I feel this is where the most importance lies.</p>

                                After a good deal of thought, I&#39;ve realized that philosophy in my life has decreased a good deal.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t had the time to think about philosophy as much as I&#39;d like. For those reasons, I&#39;ll be focusing on both technology, as a site admin, as well as philosophy (as a philosopher). I&#39;ll add the appropriate categorizations so that it will be semi-easy to switch between the two. Update, April 1, 2006 @ 8:35 Looking back at this post, it&#39;s interesting that the philosophy just hasn&#39;t grown as much as I would have liked.

                                I like PDFs. While a number of individuals will attack PDFs with blanket statements, PDFs are a great way to allow users to print documents from the Internet as intended.&nbsp; So, instead of printing off a Web page and losing 10 to 20 characters from the right-side, you can print off a document formatted specifically for printers. Of course, if you use them as the sole content delivery method, you may run into issues.

                                Yesterday I talked about site/network popularity. My closing thoughts were that I believe my site is growing and think it is &#39;popular&#39; for some fields, but that it could probably be more so. With that said, how can a smaller site attract advertisers who will, hopefully, pay (some of) the costs of creating and updating a site? In the old days, advertising on a small site meant banner networks, or exchanges.

As I said this morning, site popularity can be determined by how many people are viewing the content, and how many people are using the content.</p>

While in my last post I said host-singular, really there&#39;s two major &#39;hosts&#39;, in a manner of speaking. Usually, this will be the case. JamesRSkemp.net, for example, was one host. So, let&#39;s look at JamesRSkemp.net when it was one host.</p>

                                Today I&#39;ll be talking about how the StrivingLife.net network runs. In my opinion, you can break the network down into two large parts; my computer and my host&#39;s computer.&nbsp; There are certainly other things that come into play, such as the Internet in general, and the support of Google and the sites that it brings up in the various searches I (need to) do, but they are (almost) always applicable when you talk about the Internet.

To do that, we&#39;ll have to talk about how I got to this point.</p>

After a good deal of thought, most of it sub-conscious, I have decided what it is that I&#39;ll be doing with this WordPress, or &#39;blog&#39;.
</p>
<p>
It took a while, as one will notice by looking at the old posts - it took a great while.  Yet, I believe the wait will have given this a great purpose.</p>

While I believe there was a story regarding the first two, I can&#39;t seem to find it (I&#39;m posting these on September 2, 2007, so quite some time has gone by since thinking these up) ... Delicious Nutritious D&eacute;j&agrave; vu Child Peace Pipe The third seems too much like an album by Sir Paul, to be of much good these days ...

                                To: All Staff From: Institutional Technology and Services (ITS) It has come to our attention that a number of staff members are using so-called &lsquo;insecure&rsquo; passwords. A &lsquo;secure&rsquo; password is typically defined as a password with a combination of numbers, letters, and special characters, like spaces ( ), periods (.), and punctuation marks (like &lsquo;!&rsquo; and &lsquo;?&rsquo;). An &lsquo;insecure&rsquo; password, on the other hand, is typically defined as an easily guessed word, like &lsquo;password&rsquo;, &lsquo;me&rsquo;, &lsquo;help&rsquo;, various other four letter words, and the ever popular &lsquo;god&rsquo;.

What this means is that I&#39;ll finally give Gavin a real idea of what I think about the book.&nbsp; Right now, I&#39;m still going towards good - the beginning was uncomfortable (the voice he used) but when he gets into politics it&#39;s quite good.&nbsp; I&#39;ve marked a number of passages that I&#39;ve found to be noteworthy, so if this continues, I might just bump it up to great.&nbsp; Both &#39;ratings&#39; assume that you like Clinton.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t, you might find his &lt;em&gt;experience X taught me to do Y when I was in Z office/president&lt;/em&gt; to be a bit much (?).

Back when I was in college, I can recall talking to one Ms. Tessa Gruszynski regarding how, basically, I was going to stop caring about, or being kind to, strangers. I believe the particular item was holding open doors for people who would make no gesture of thanks.

                                ***CONFIDENTIAL*** ***FOR TEAM LEADERSHIP ONLY*** ***PLEASE SHRED IF FOUND*** It&rsquo;s come to my attention that a number of team players have been taking full sixty minute lunch breaks in the past couple of weeks. As I&rsquo;m sure you all recall from our last outing in late April, most of our team players had been taking anywhere between thirty and fifty minute lunch breaks.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s quite surprising, with these figures in mind, that our team players are now taking sixty minute breaks.&nbsp; I wonder why it is that this is now occurring.&nbsp; Can someone clarify for me why, not even two months later, we&rsquo;re seeing this change?

I was sceptical whether my machine, a HP Pavilion a620n, with standard specifications, could play Unreal Tournament 2004. Since I had a couple of hours to kill, late one night, I decided I would try downloading the demo, to see if it would run on my machine. I had previously downloaded the Unreal Tournament 2003 demo as well, to also see if I could get that to run, and had bought the Unreal Tournament, Game of the Year Edition, for an older computer. To make a long opening short, this guide is going to go over Unreal Tournament and the HP Pavilion a620n, with standard specifications (id est, no altercations). If you&#39;re using this computer, and would like to use one of these programs, I&#39;m going to tell you if you can.

This way, our users would be completely entertained while waiting for their search results.

While reading a past news item regarding the <a href="http://www.wisbar.org/divisions/yld/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">Young Lawyers Division of the State Bar of Wisconsin</a>, I asked myself if donating was equal to volunteering. The Young Lawyers Division (YLD) collects business clothing from lawyers to give to lawyers who cannot afford business clothing. If lawyer X donates clothing to the YLD, is lawyer X volunteering? To get to the answer to this question, I have to proof that volunteering implies, or suggests, donating, and that donating implies volunteering. If either is not the case, or if both are not the case, then volunteering is not the same as donating.</p>

On a cold sunny day in March, little Billy Ann and little Bobby Jo happened upon a street. Billy Ann and Bobby Jo had happened upon this street before, but never on a Sunday, and never when alone. Of course, they had each other, and that is truly what usually matters. Yet our story does not end like this, for Billy Ann and Bobby Jo were about to cross the line and be the little naughty children that every child dreads that they will one day become.

Back on the second of February 2002, I first, as far as I can recall or prove, wrote down the question &ldquo;Is it better to live a lie, or know the truth and cry?&rdquo; The item that this was written in was an item called <em>Guide to One Philosophy of Life: Revision 1</em>, and consisted of twelve pages of material from January 30, 2002 to September 29, 2002. While I kept saying that I was going to get back to it and revise it, I never did.
</p>
<p>
A recent item on a LiveJournal journal, along with something I had read earlier in the day on the same area, reminded me of this quote that I had written so long ago. After some searching, I found it in the item mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
My task here is to discuss this question that I have raised. Of course, it being April 27 2005, I should point out that I do not have an answer to this question as of yet. Perhaps that suggests that I am doing more of the former than the latter, or perhaps it is because the latter has gotten me no closer to the answer of this question.

According to David Gries (via his site), logician Raymond Smullyan stated the following word problem in one of his many books, which regards lying knaves and truthful knights.

There is an old saying that says something to the effect of &ldquo;if you try hard enough, you can become anything, even president&rdquo; (the President of the United States is usually implied, but the general idea is the ruler of a country/government). I was thinking one day that there must be certain states in which certain individuals have little chance of actually becoming President of the United States, so I undertook to find out what states Presidents have come from, and look at what states Presidents have not come from.

Learning a program can be quite fun and rewarding, but can also be somewhat disarming. While there were a number of guides on the Internet that discussed <a href="http://www.eclectasy.com/Fractal-Explorer/">Fractal Explorer</a>, I felt that none of them did any great service to this great program. So, I set out to create my own guide, in a format that did not force a user to view only a small amount of information at a time.

In Frank Stockton&rsquo;s 1882 piece <em>The Lady or the Tiger</em>, Stockton asks us to determine the ending of the story. While one thinks they have enough information to make an informed decision and come to the correct answer, they in fact do not. His later piece, <em>The Discourager of Hesitancy</em>, also continues this tradition. Of course, Stockton is not the only writer to use this method to capture an audience. However, Stockton is one of the few to take this method to such a level. For this article I&rsquo;ll be discussing Stockton&rsquo;s pieces, as well as other cases of this in the media, including Tarantino&rsquo;s movie <cite><a href="http://words.strivinglife.com/words/post/Pulp-Fiction-A-Timeline-of-the-Events-of-the-Movie.aspx">Pulp Fiction</a></cite>.

                                A while ago, I wrote an article regarding InboxDollars.com (also known as, InboxDollar$.com). That article, On InboxDollar$.com, and similar programs, discussed some of the good things about this site and it&rsquo;s program. However, I feel as though some additional information could be given. Specifically, I feel as though people are afraid to enter into these kinds of sites for a couple of reasons, which I detail, and hopefully dispel, below. First, people hesitate giving out their email in general, at least after having been spammed by a number of sources.

If you&rsquo;re going to read more on Arthur Schopenhauer, I suggest you start with his main works, followed by other primary resources (id est, books written by him), followed by secondary resources. 
</p>
<p>
For ease, I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of books currently available to the English language reader. Obviously, if you can read German, it makes little sense to purchase any of the translations, since the language the work was written in is better suited for Schopenhauer&rsquo;s original thoughts.

                                Linking to documents that are found online is almost always a troublesome issue. Unlike print documents, that one could purchase online, read in the library, or read in a bookstore &ndash; for those that don&rsquo;t like to purchase books &ndash; online documents are fairly fluid. This is because one major reason, as well as a few other reasons.

                                First it was Afghanistan. Next, it was Iraq, Iran and North Korea, parts of the &lsquo;axis of evil&rsquo;. Now Condoleezza Rice is calling our attention to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Zimbabwe, Burma and Belarus (Belarus? Is anyone else wondering where this is? And I keep myself fairly up to date on these things, I thought.). Gavin introduced me to Noam Chomsky&rsquo;s spoken word, so I understand why Cuba would be a threat to the United States.

                                She was an attractive woman, quite attractive in fact. She was the kind of girl that you couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at if she gave you her eyes, even if you were having one of the most shit-filled days in your life up to that point. She walked over, not quickly, but not slow. It was a perfect pace for a girl in her profession. If you move to quickly, you make the customer think that you&rsquo;re desperate, while moving too slow gives off a feeling of disinterest, or boredom, both of which scare a customer away, or instil a like sensation within them.

                                Something has been on my mind for a number of months as of late regarding stoplights and cars. People tend to, and perhaps naturally, speed, and my article regarding speed limits (On the Speed Limit) is fairly popular because of it. However, people also tend to not stop for yellow lights, and sometimes even for red lights, but would much rather drive through them. This raised the question of whether it really is best to be the last one through a stoplight (speed up while the light is yellow), or if it makes more sense to not &lsquo;run&rsquo; the light, and instead be the very first one in &lsquo;line&rsquo; at the light.

                                Somewhat major news is the fact that Blockbuster&trade;, the popular video and game rental store, is ending late fees. While it&rsquo;s certainly interesting news, reading up on this you&rsquo;ll find that Blockbuster&trade; hasn&rsquo;t really ended late fees, rather they have changed them in order to make more money[1]. For those of us new to late fees, these are basically fees imposed by a rental agency for not returning the rented items by the due date.

                                The average computer user is not an IT (Information Technology) professional. That said, the average computer user, computer users below average (especially), and many above average computer users, will end up with some kind of computer related problem at least once while using computers. There are a great number of reasons why this will occur, but for the most part it is because there are a number of programs out there that attempt to use computers for a specific purpose, while ignoring the desires of the computer&rsquo;s user.

After the 2004 election, where Bush won by allowing the American public to live their lives in fear (see my own <em>On the Saying &ldquo;Terrorists Will Put Bush in Office&rdquo;</em>), I decided to look at the voting record of Wisconsin, whether they could pick a President, or not.

(MP3 format) If you&rsquo;re like me, and I&rsquo;ll be assuming that you are during this article, then you&rsquo;ve probably seen a lot more use of &lsquo;clown shoes&rsquo; on the Internet. For whatever reason, this is not occurring simply on sites in the industry of &lsquo;all things clown&rsquo;, but is also occurring on some of the larger, and more popular, web communities.

                                Looking through an old philosophy anthology, Biomedical Ethics: Fifth Edition, I found and read On Lying to Patients, by Mack Lipkin. After reading this piece, I was again made to realize how much I dislike ethics. While Lipkin sets out to give us a theory, or method, he leaves us with more questions than answers. For this article, I would like to discuss whether doctors have an ethical obligation to tell the truth to their patients.

                                So I had seen the 10th Anniversary DVD Edition of Myst before the holiday rush, and was planning on making a purchase when I thought things would settle down a little bit.&nbsp;I also wanted to pick up a couple of copies of The Beatles, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure which CDs (until I heard Norwegian Wood on the radio on the way &ndash; more about this and my interest in The Beatles in another article).&nbsp;However, this most recent experience was absolutely horrid (as I said in my online survey, perhaps a harsh word, but it may just be necessary), and required that I write some general thoughts I had regarding Best Buy, and similar stores/experiences at such stores.&nbsp;Note that while I specifically reference Best Buy, many of these comments can be applied to stores of a similar nature and should be construed as such.

The saying &ldquo;Shitcakes&rdquo; is in no way a popular saying[1]. In fact, it&rsquo;s something of a rarity in the world today. However, since it is a saying that I have heard many a time, and since I wanted to try to understand where this statement may have originated, I decided to try to work through its significance.

You can download them below, in PDF format. These two sheets will allow you to have a guide you can use to cross off numbers as you use them.

                                I was at work, doing work, when I suddenly realized that the story of the fall really does have some importance, outside of the religions that teach it. The story of the fall is the story of Eve and Adam dining on the fruit of the tree of knowledge, or wisdom. I&rsquo;d like to discuss here what I have found to be the true significance of this story. First, there are a few major items, or things, that need to be discussed in any discussion of this story.

                                Checking my referrers, I often ran across the phrase &lsquo;Richard Skemp&rsquo; (sometimes with initial caps, often without). Since I like to be able to help people, I figured I would take a look at whom this individual is. The following is what I was able to learn from my foray into the information online. Mathematics is a necessary tool in everyday life. One of the problems, however, that I often find myself thinking about, is how you teach someone math.

                                There&rsquo;s a lot of hoopla about making money online for doing very little. I can remember, when I first got onto the Internet for extended amounts of time, during my early college years, when my roommate, Jeremy Peterson, would find something online and share it with me. Sometimes these things ended up being busts, but sometimes they would end up fairly big. Napster, for example, was probably introduced to me by him, which was a great thing until it went down.

                                As a Halloween gift to myself, I picked up a copy of Syberia&trade; at Best Buy yesterday afternoon. Since then, and after trying out a controller I picked up to play my PSX games on my PC, I&rsquo;ve been playing it (Syberia&trade;) with a few breaks, here and there. What follows are my thoughts on the game thus far, with around half the game complete. First off, the game is extremely aesthetically pleasing.

Google it if you&#39;d like to see it for yourself (or just browse Something Awful), or read on. One of the easiest kinds of humour is the kind at the expense of another. Honestly, it&#39;s funny to see someone suffer some kind of hardship or accident.

                                Notes: While primarily based upon The Future of an Illusion, Civilization and Its Discontents may have crept into this discussion. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, seeing as how the latter is a sequel of the former, but if you have not read the latter, some of the ideas here may be new to you. Sigmund Freud tells us, near the end of the work, that &ldquo;the sole purpose&rdquo; of The Future of an Illusion is point out the necessity of man surmounting infantilism.

                                Listen to On the Saying &#39;God is Odd&#39; (MP3 format). An old and popular saying states that &lsquo;God is odd&rsquo;. But is there any validity to this claim? This article shows that there is indeed validity and truth to this claim. God consists, or is equal to the addition, of three characters; &lsquo;G&rsquo;, &lsquo;o&rsquo;, and &lsquo;d&rsquo;. If a number is not evenly divisible by two, that number is odd. Three divided by two is one-and-one-half, therefore three is not evenly divisible by two.

                                Ren&eacute; Descartes&rsquo; Meditations on First Philosophy consists of three parts; a preface to the reader, a synopsis, and the six mediations themselves.&nbsp; Heralded as the first &lsquo;modern&rsquo; thinker in philosophy, Descartes introduces the problem encompassed by &lsquo;dualism&rsquo;: how is it that mind and body can interact with each other?&nbsp; Descartes also questions how it is that we can know reality.&nbsp; While the quick answer is through our senses, depending upon our senses opens us up to questions of how we know that our senses are correct.

                                The reason most people foresee George W. Bush taking the presidency in the 2004 election is because most people believe Bush has the best chance protecting America from terrorists, compared with John Kerry.&nbsp; The question is, what does this mean? Put bluntly, this means that despite Bush&rsquo;s record from 2000 to the present, fear will put Bush in the Oval Office for another 4 years &ndash; fear brought on by an arbitrary colour system &ndash; fear of a people on the other side of the world, attacking us because we believe in freedom, or so they say.

Gandhi was convinced much of the violence in society and in our personal lives stems from the passive violence that we commit against each other. He described these acts of passive violence as the &quot;Seven Blunders.&quot; Grandfather gave me the list in 1947 just before we left India to return to South Africa where my father, Manilal, Gandhi&#39;s second son, and my mother, Sushila, worked for nonviolent change.

                                <p>
The reason I picked up Martin Heidegger&#39;s <cite>The Principle of Reason</cite> was quite simple - having read Arthur Schopenhauer&#39;s <cite>The World as Will and Representation</cite> and agreed with many of his points, I attempt to further my knowledge of his principles as much as possible. While Heidegger doesn&#39;t mention Schopenhauer a single time in his thirteen Lectures, nor in his Address, Schopenhauer certainly discusses the Principle of Reason, pulling off of Leibniz, and is therefore a blatant oversight of Heidegger&#39;s to not mention Schopenhauer at all. Whether this is unintentional one cannot know from simply the text, but for a German philosopher to not know another German philosopher who covered the same content is quite surprising, to say the very least.

                                Rest. Passivity. Inactivity. All speak of the absence of movement &ndash; the absence of activity &ndash; in common language. Yet, when I stand still is it really very different than when I am moving about? Is inactivity really the absence of activity? Let us say I am walking down the street. I see a beautiful manikin in a storefront window with short, shoulder length, red hair. While it is true that I am no longer in motion &ndash; I no longer advance down the street, I still made a choice to stop at the particular storefront window and look in.

The following is meant to be an overview of <em>The Principles of Philosophy</em>, or, the<em> Monadology</em> (1714), by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716). My main interest in Leibniz is to see how his work relates to the works of Arthur Schopenhauer. Any notes that I make should be read with this in mind.

                                Listen to On Karate (MP3 format). The best thing about Karate is that you can be walking down the street with someone and they can bust a Karate Move&trade; just like that. Karate, pronounced care-aht-tay, is more than just a way of life; it&rsquo;s also a way of being and living. On a scale from one to ten, it&rsquo;s ten times God. One time I was walking down the street with my friend and he was like &lsquo;Woah!

                                The Internet consists of a couple different kinds of sites. In the first place, we have educational sites, such as universities, libraries, and working groups. We also have business sites, which include sites that sell products online, as well as those that offer technical support through their site. Personal sites, another category, take up another chunk of the Internet. Personal sites can vary between a journal of an individual, to a compilation of multiple individuals (either in design or content).

                                What happens to a dream deferred? I ask What happens to a dream deterred? Could it be that the dream is the life deterred? If the dream is the life deterred, and the dream is deferred, then what? Is not the dream a life? Is not the life a dream? Is there one life? Is there one dream? Perhaps it is as such, that the dream is not singular. Perhaps it is as such, that the life is not singular.

I, having read contrary statements in articles that you had previously written, felt that the very least I could was point out said statements to this individual, as well as suggest to them that they contact you directly regarding said statements.

                                I must admit that Robert Heilbroner&#39;s An Inquiry Into the Human Prospect was not quite the book that I thought it was going to be. The title and cover were what drew me to the book, and the back cover information had little impact, if any, because I realized after reading the book that I may not have read it... Of course, Heilbroner refers to Hobbes at least once, and Marx quite a few times, and since these two are political philosophers, and since philosophy runs through everything, I wasn&#39;t displeased with the book in the least.

Let&#39;s assume, firstly, that you are driving in a 55 mile per hour (mph) zone. Now, that is the speed limit, or, in other words, the limitation of traffic/vehicle speed. Now, if you are going 55 mph, then you are going 100% of the allocated speed. That is, you are going 55 in a 55 zone.
</p>
<p>
Now, if you are going 50 mph, in that same 55 mph zone, then you are going 90.90% of the allocated speed (50 / 55). So, you are going ~ 9.1% under the speed limit (5 / 55). Now, if you are going 5 mph over the speed limit, or 60 mph, then you are going ~ 9.1% over the speed limit, or, 109% of the allocated speed limit (60 / 55). Now, 109% over the posted speed limit is not that bad.
</p>
<p>
Now, let us assume that you are going 65 mph in a 55 mph zone. 65 / 55 is equal to 1.18, so, you are going 118% over the speed limit. Now, what about 7 mph over the speed limit (in a 55 mph zone)? Well, 62 mph translates to ~ 113% of the speed limit, or 13% over the speed limit.
</p>
<p>
Now, let us take that 7 mph and translate it to a few different speeds, which tend to be common road speeds (at least in Wisconsin), as well as what 5 mph over the speed limit would be, as well as 10 mph over. All percentages are rounded to the nearest percent (1%) in this and in later tables.

                                Dear Sirs: I thank you for your interest in my system, as well as for your interesting comments. I do not think, however, that you clearly understood my main points about the goals, or end, of life. Please find here my thoughts regarding this. I look forward to your comments regarding this. As I said before, everything leads towards one goal, which &#39;results&#39; in the end of history. After all, the telos is final, and therefore leaves room for no other causes.

See the complete script for Waking Life. There is more to this then the discussion about God. This is packed full with a lot of various things, all of which deserve some time. I&#39;ll start with this passage first. However, before I do that, I should point out that I&#39;m not sure whether or not these two are both film directors.

As with the 19th century figure Kierkegaard, one could quite easily ask whether the 19th century writer Nietzsche is a philosopher. After all, if we compare their writings to the writings of such 19th century philosophers as Hegel and Schopenhauer, we are confronted with quite a difference. Yet, basing our decision of whether someone is a philosopher on the format of their writings is, I believe, flawed. Rather, one should base their decision of whether someone is a philosopher on the <em>content</em> of the writings. For this paper, I will be doing exactly this: I will be looking at the content of Nietzsche&#39;s writings in order to show that he is doing philosophy, and is therefore a philosopher.

                                It&#39;s said that &quot;a penny saved is a penny earned,&quot; but is that really true? How can it be that by saving something you earn it? Doesn&#39;t the fact that you already have, in this case, a penny prohibit you from earning it, since we usually give something to someone and say they earned it...? After some thought regarding this topic I have come to find a possible answer to the question of what this saying means.

While the exact date of the foundation of Thebes, located 30 miles northwest of Athens in eastern Boeotia, has not been clearly established, ruins have been found dating back to 1300 B.C. (Wiseman, p.624). One of the reasons that so little is known about Thebes is that it doesn&#39;t play any major roles in history until the sixth century B.C. However, one myth concerning Thebes&#39; origin does exist that is important to mention due to its inclusion of known figures of Greek tragedy.

                                Michael Dawson, in his book Understanding Cognitive Science attempts to provide a basic understanding of cognitive science, specifically by dealing with and using the &quot;tri-level&quot; hypothesis. For this paper, I will be discussing the tri-level hypothesis and what it tells us about cognitive science. One of the major problems in any science is the problem of discussing the findings within a set field with people outside of the field. Because of this problem, time is instead spent on some lesser subjects, such as sports and the weather.

                                I recently, while daydreaming yet again in a class, happened upon the phrase residing on the side of a McDonald&#39;s cup stating that &quot;Change is Good&quot;. I, of course, am quite familiar with this saying, however, I was a tad confused. Because of this confusion, I decided that it would be best for me to go ahead and examine the saying &quot;Change is Good&quot; in order to see just what was meant by this saying.

Might as well type them up and trash the paper &hellip; &#39;U.S.&#39; versus &#39;Them&#39; While most people believe that the popular saying &quot;us versus them&quot; means, or says, that it&#39;s you with anyone else versus those contrary to you in some regard - the &#39;thems.&#39; However, it is not so much that is you and your group versus &#39;them&#39; as it is the United States versus &#39;them&#39; - namely those that are not the allies of the United States, but sometimes even the allies of the United States.

Quite a few years ago I took a lower level Introduction to Biology course in college. While I did pretty bad in the course, I did learn quite a few things. One of the things that I learned was about the &#39;Biological Imperative&#39;. The &#39;Biological Imperative&#39;, as I now understand it - whether or not it was taught like this - is that all biological beings are born/created (not in the &#39;Creation&#39; sense, but rather as a way to express plants, which are not born, per se, and some animals, which are hatched, and are not, per se, born) with certain desires/strivings. These strivings are applicable to any, and all, biological entities. For this article, I&#39;d like to discuss the Biological Imperative in various ways. First, I&#39;d like to describe what I believe the Biological Imperative is, at it&#39;s fundamental root - at a level basic, and truly applicable, to any and all biological entities. Then, I&#39;d like to mention how culture appears to fit into all of this, bringing in Philosophy when possible and applicable.

Starting from the truth that &quot;the world is my representation&quot; [3], Arthur Schopenhauer&#39;s <em>The World as Will and Representation</em> lays down what Schopenhauer believes the world is. After determining that the world is not only representation, but also will, he goes on to discuss how this all works together, and how other philosophers work into this system. For this paper, I will be focusing on the relationship between aesthetic contemplation and asceticism within this work.

Unless you&#39;ve been lying in a coma, or spending an extraordinary amount of time playing such games as Sid Meier&#39;s SIMGolf&trade;, SimCity 3000&trade; Unlimited, Age of Empires II, Solitaire, etcetera, or, if you&#39;re just reading this (perhaps) long after I&#39;ve written it, you probably heard that Arnold Schwarzenegger (see Running Man, Terminator, Terminator 2, Terminator 3, Kindergarten Cop, Total Recall, etcetera) has become, according to the masses of Californians that went out to vote, the next Governor of California, taking the place of the recalled (the second in the nation) Governor, Gray Davis (I personally keep thinking it should be Gary, but... interesting name I suppose). There&#39;s a lot going on with this, Arnold becoming the next Governor, and I&#39;ve put off writing this page for that reason, as well as for a few other reasons... Anyways, even though I live in Wisconsin, I figured I&#39;d tackle a few of the things that I&#39;ve thought whilst paying attention to this. Here goes :)

However, what I really want to have is an example of the great use Disk Investigator is. In order to do this, I&#39;m going to set up an example - an example of a situation that is not too uncommon - in order to show just how powerful it is. I urge you to follow along, with my example, on your own computer.

                                According to Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, the dialectic &quot;is in general the principle of all motion, of all life, and of all activation in the actual world&quot;, as well as &quot;the soul of all genuinely scientific cognition.&quot; [1: 171] In other words, Hegel believes that the dialectic is the soul - the spirit one may say - of scientific cognition, or thought, as per the second quote. Because of this, if one wants to perform science, if one wants to study, and understand, the world around oneself, the dialectic must be used, and understood.

                                &quot;Just once wouldn&#39;t you love for someone to simply show you the evidence for God&#39;s existence? No armtwisting. No statements of, &quot;You just have to believe.&quot; Well, here is an attempt to candidly offer some of the reasons which suggest that God exists.&quot; [1] Sounds like an interesting, and bold, statement. After all, people have been attempting to prove God&#39;s existence by use of reason almost as long, and as much, as they have been using force to.

I brought you the timeline for Pulp Fiction (see my paper titled Pulp Fiction: A Timeline of the Events of the Movie), now I bring you the timeline for the movie 12 Monkeys, another interesting, and time-wise &#39;weird&#39;, movie. As I see it, it&#39;s something like this. Well, first, note that this is the timeline in terms of real time, not in terms of movie time.

                                I heard you talking just the other day. &nbsp; You talked like Aphrodite, that damned goddess of old, You were talking in her ear and it made me feel so cold... &nbsp; I would give you all the attention, perhaps more then you could hold, I&#39;d put my heart on the block, and not expect a &#39;thunk&#39;. &nbsp; Do you hurt me on purpose? Did those before? I&#39;m not an artist, but I&#39;ve a bleeding heart...

It is said that &quot;Idle Hands Are The Devil&#39;s Tools&quot;, meaning that when one is bored, one tends to get into trouble. I have a problem, or concern, with this statement however. Let&#39;s say I&#39;m bored and I end up setting fire to a kerosene soaked blanket which ends up leading to my home becoming engulfed in flames. Now, if we want to get technical, which is exactly what I want to do, then as soon as my hands are no longer idle - as soon as I begin to do something with my hands - they are not the devil&#39;s tools, right?

So, you&#39;re chewing on something, who knows exactly what (well, you know what - use your imagination) when you come to the realization that there is a hair in your mouth. You may not have any idea where it came from, whether it is a hair off of the top of your head, that fell onto your food, or what, but you know that it&#39;s in your mouth now. It&#39;s a fairly long hair, an inch and a half to two inches long probably. Anyways, one way or another, the hair is now in your mouth. Yet, for some reason, you decide not to take it out of your mouth. Instead, you decide that you don&#39;t really want to put your fingers in your mouth, for whatever reason. So, you munch on your food and end up swallowing your food. Yet, for some reason, the hair gets stuck in your throat. You attempt to clear your throat - once, twice - yet&nbsp;... nothing really happens, other then the hairs focus in your mind. That is, you realize, more and more, that the hair does not seem to be moveable. You clear your throat again and feel a pain, like getting a paper cut. Know what that feels like, when you finally realize that you have a paper cut? It&#39;s&nbsp;... well, let&#39;s imagine what that feels like now&nbsp;...

                                One of the most heard sayings in the customer service business is &quot;the customer is always right&quot;. The common meaning of this statement is that no matter what the customer says, they are to be treated as though they are correct. Let us take an example. Customer orders a burger with no ketchup and with no cheese. They ask for it to be this way. Then, after getting their burger, they come up to the counter and say that they didn&#39;t get the cheese on the burger, even though they asked for it.

                                Another version of this, slightly updated it seems, is also available, titled Thomas Aquinas&rsquo; Summa Theologica and the Question of the Will. Whenever I think about Medieval Philosophy, from this point on after taking this class, I will also think about religion. When I think about religion I think about God and free will. So, since I need to have a topic for this final analysis, I decided that I should probably take one of these topics, and find some writer who would be the best to analysis in this area.

                                This semester, we looked at Michael Corrado&rsquo;s Analytic Tradition in Philosophy: Background and Issues, Tim Crane&rsquo;s Elements of Mind: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind, and The Cambridge Companion to Husserl. Through these writings we have learned more about the Theory of Intentionality, from two different perspectives, the Analytic Philosophy tradition &ndash; as shown by Corrado and Crane &ndash; and the Phenomenological tradition &ndash; as showcased by Husserl, or, more perhaps more appropriately, the individuals writing on Husserl.

Algazali, in The Incoherence of the Philosophers, argues that &ldquo;what is customarily believed to be cause and what is believed to be an effect is not necessary, according to our opinion; but each of the two [namely, cause and effect] is independent of the other.&rdquo; [1: 283] In other words, while philosophers believe that there exists such a law that if x occurs then y occurs &ndash; that there is a system of cause and effect &ndash; Algazali believes that there is no relationship between cause and effect.

                                Francis Bacon&#39;s New Atlantis was the first chosen source to read for this Age of Reason class. Bacon&#39;s work best fits as a beginning reading for various reasons, one of which is the applicability of the book as showcasing the major ideas of the Age of Reason at the beginning of their formation, in many cases. For this paper, I will begin by examining Bacon&#39;s New Atlantis, in a specific area, and then pursuing that area&#39;s progress, or reiteration, in some of the other readings from this age.

                                We often hear of the importance of one. This will briefly look at the numbers of just how important one is. After that, I&rsquo;d like to discuss this issue (knowing full well that I will end up going off on a tangent). The importance of one person when there are x people: x people % that one person equals (1/x)*100 1 100 2 50 3 33.3 4 25 5 20 6 16.6 7 14.285714 8 12.5 9 11.1 10 10 11 9.09 12 8.3 13 7.692307 14 7.142857 15 6.6 16 6.25 17 5.8823529411764705 18 5.5 19 5.263157894736842105 20 5 21 4.761904 22 4.54 23 4.347826086956521739130 24 4.16 25 4 26 3.846153 27 3.703 28 3.571428 29 3.4482758620689655172413793103 30 3.3 31 3.225806451612903 32 3.125 33 3.03 34 2.9411764705882352 35 2.857142 With these 35 results, we see that the importance of one, in percent, decreases fairly quickly, and then slowly goes lower.

                                Often times we will hear one say to another that they do not believe in God. They will then say, as a way to prove to the other that they are right, that God does not exist, that if God exists then God would have the power to strike him down, as he is a non-believer. Of course, this cannot happen for various reasons, which I will attempt to discuss below.

                                In Tim Crane&rsquo;s book, Elements of Mind: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind, we are given a contemporary look at the Analytic Tradition, and their use of the ideas of Intentionality to come to the truth about perception and thought.&nbsp; Crane attempts to explain to the reader how perception and thought are related, as well as the role of intentionality in relation to perception and thought. For the most part, when we speak of the terms &lsquo;perception&rsquo; and &lsquo;thought&rsquo; we can rely almost solely upon a particular individual.&nbsp; For example, imagine that we have one individual, whom we will call Gavin, looking at some object, which, for simplicity, we will say is a particular can of Dr Pepper sitting in front of him.

                                1. According to Augustine, God is not responsible for the existence of evil. What is his argument? Present the argument in detail. In On Free Will, Augustine speaks of man&rsquo;s freedom to will, or make decisions, for himself. He also speaks of evil, and how a man can do evil, as well as where evil comes from. Now, Augustine believes that man is inclined to do Good, which is to follow God and seek out happiness, through virtuous activity, and not through the goods of this physical world.

                                The following is a paper written for a Religion and Medieval Philosophy course. Every time I heard someone speak of scholasticism I never quite knew what they meant. Having heard of it in many classes in the philosophy of religion &lsquo;genera&rsquo;, I was convinced that it was something that refers to philosophers who dealt with the philosophy of religion, and specifically in the time period of the medieval era &ndash; especially around the years of St Thomas Aquinas and St Augustine.

                                I fell in love with you, but you didn&#39;t know. I thought every night of you, but every night you slept well. I cried when I put my mind on you, but every day it got a little better. I listen to the bands and see you, but more and more you fade. I think I was in love with you, but were you a passing phase... I thought there was more to you, but one can never really tell.

                                This paper was written for a Religion and Medieval Philosophy course. The material of this text analysis will be Peter Abailard and his work The Glosses of Peter Abailard on Porphyry. As Abailard tells us, &ldquo;There are then three questions, as Boethius says, secret and very useful and tried by not a few philosophers, but solved by few. The first is as follows, namely, whether genera and species subsist or are placed in the naked understandings alone, etc., as if he were to say: whether they have true being or whether they consist in opinion alone.

                                In Michael Corrado&rsquo;s Analytic Tradition in Philosophy: Background and Issues, we are introduced to the analytical tradition in a way that has not been attempted since the time of this book. Instead of bundling philosophical works into an anthology Corrado attempts to explain what the fundamental characteristics are that tie these thinkers together. For this paper, I focus solely on the problems of perception and thought in the earlier analytic tradition, as Corrado discusses in this work, particularly on the first part, in which he discusses the background of the tradition &ndash; and therefore the earlier tradition.

                                The following was written for a Religion and Medieval Philosophy course. In Augustine&rsquo;s The City of God, Augustine discusses what he thinks the City of God would be like. While there is no one particular page or passage that especially stuck out for me, I&rsquo;m going focus on what Augustine says about other gods/religions and how that compares to what many people think in today&rsquo;s society. For this analysis, I would like to show some of the reasons that I think this.

                                I was a sad man when they buried him in the cold depths. I was a sad man when they gave me the flag that my brother had rightly fought for. I was a sad man when they dug up his grave on a hot June night. I was a sad man when they caught them fools that tried to steal my brother&#39;s ring. I was a sad man when they put them in jail, instead of putting them in a loop.

                                First of all, I would like to share a screen capture from one of my visits to AOL.com on December 8th, 2002. Screen capture from 2002.12.08 Basically, and I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not as clear as one would like, I visited http://www.aol.com/ and received this message.

                                For over 2500 years, philosophers have debated on such issues as rights, reality, freedom, and justice. In all of those years, one decision on what is meant by these terms has never been set in stone; a final definition - or answer - has never been reached. Therefore, when someone asks the philosopher, or even one who has merely studied philosophy, what justice is, or what any of the other terms mean exactly, there is typically not one answer that is prevalent to all.

                                Edmund Husserl, in his Ideas Pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology and to a Phenomenological Philosophy, begins by discussing natural cognition and experience. Husserl explores experience, believing that experience is how we view the world around us. However, it is not enough to know that experience gives us insight. According to Husserl, we must, primarily, know how we are conscious of the world around us, before we can talk about the actuality of what we see.

                                The nineteenth century could be described as containing three major movements; Romanticism, Realism, and Modernism. Each movement has its own important features and major themes that have had an effect on the present day world. If I had to state one of the major themes of the entire nineteenth century, it would be the increase of the power of man and science. The beginning of the nineteenth century saw writers such as Mary Shelley, with her work Frankenstein.

                                Part I The question of what it is that makes one particular experiment ethical while another is unethical is a troublesome question. Is the ethicalness of a scientific experiment based upon whether the subject is harmed, whether the subject&#39;s rights have been in some way infringed upon, or is it based upon some other criteria? In this paper, I will take the position that it is not whether the subject was harmed, or whether their rights were infringed upon, but rather that it is ultimately power that determines the ethicalness of an experiment (position IV).

                                One of the most prevalent themes in the readings for this class has been religion, or mysticism, and its influence on and necessity for both man and society. The question that keeps arising is, however, can man and society live do without religion, or something similar? The modern man has more trust, for the most part, in science then he has in religion. However, what does this mean? First, I would like to take a look at what religion has done for man, in relation to the readings in general.

                                See also my paper tiled: Philosophy, Politics, and Law Final Regarding Justice and Various Philosophers. For my paper, I was going to attempt to answer what justice is. Obviously, Plato&#39;s Republic will be of use for this topic. Particularly his discussion with others, as well as how he thinks the state should be setup. I&#39;m not going to put any of Machiavelli&#39;s The Prince in my paper, because I wasn&#39;t too much of a fan of him, and he doesn&#39;t really go into what justice &#39;really&#39; is.

                                <p>Recently, while listening to a philosophical discussion, I came to hear that there were not two kinds of inference (deductive and inductive), as I thought before, but instead that there were three kinds; deductive, inductive, and abductive. Wanting to know more about abductive reasoning, I did a little search, finding the following information.</p>

                                In his Notes from Underground, Fyodor Dostoevsky asks what it is that civilization, or society in general, gives to the individual. In essence, the question concerns where the individual resides in society; what can be learned from man&#39;s place in a society? Dostoevsky presents to the reader a conflicted, sickly individual, and explores why the individual is the way he is, as well as whether society could do anything to help him from his lowly state.

                                <p>It is important to mention what sentential logic is. While my guide has been out for almost two years now, I&rsquo;ve yet to discuss what these rules are for. Sentential logic is one logical system, by which conclusions can be reached via premises, which may or may not be true. The truth of the premises does not concern sentential logic. Rather, sentential logic will tell you what conclusions necessarily come from the premises posited.</p>

I&#39;d tell someone, and I&#39;d only end up with pain, a blistering pain. I have chunks missing, each time, I have less on the scale. I try my best, I know that I do, but it&#39;s hard, you know?

                                In this paper, I will be discussing the points that Antony Flew contributes to the debate on whether religious claims must be proven by empirical means in order to be factually meaningful. First, I will discuss Flew&rsquo;s major contribution, which is the analogy of the gardener. Second, I will discuss why this analogy helps to show that religious claims make no assertions, and are instead mere utterances. Flew begins his piece with a parable.

                                The following was written from January 30, 2002 to September 29, 2002, but I am just now (January 30, 2009) getting around to posting this. I can honestly admit that I haven&#39;t read over this in a very long time, but the skimming that I have done reminds me of certain things ... As time progresses I may go back and re-purpose this content. (Of particular note, also, will be at what time these were written and when I was reading certain philosophical works.) One has to question many of the things that many people take as being commonplace, or common knowledge.

                                But the thing of it is, is that you cannot possibly know what that is like. But I don&#39;t need to try it in order to know that I am not going to like it. It&#39;s something that I know, something that I will always know. I mean, you were told by your friends what it would be like, but I don&#39;t have that, I don&#39;t have friends that I could get that information from.

                                During the period of Romanticism, art and literature was attempting to get back to, and raise interest in, the natural. With more people in cities, as well as the effects of Industrialization, many were feeling that man was moving too fast. For this paper, I am going to talk about man&#39;s quest for dominance over nature, with particular interest in Mary Shelley&#39;s Frankenstein. Throughout history, man has been trying to become a controller of nature.

                                Descartes&rsquo; rationalist notion of necessary and contingent connections between simple natures has an important role in his Meditations. This, in turn, has an impact on other philosophers to come, in relation to the problems that the Meditations raise. This paper will first deal with simple natures, their connections, and their role in Descartes&rsquo; Meditations. After looking at Descartes, three other philosophers will be looked at to see how they deal with the ideas brought up by Descartes.

                                What is the impact that civilization and its laws have on the individual? Particularly in the case of values and morality, does civilization help define one's values, or does it subvert them, leaving behind only those values that it can use in order to survive and converting those it can not? For this paper, I would like to look at Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and show how Sigmund Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents is related to this story.

                                &ldquo;Let us suppose that organ transplant procedures have been perfected; in such circumstances if two dying patients could be saved by organ transplants then, if surgeon have the requisite organs in stock and no other needy patients, but nevertheless allow their patients to die, we would be inclined to say, and be justified in saying, that the patients died because the doctors refused to save them. But if there are no spare organs in stock and none otherwise available, the doctors have no choice, they cannot save their patients and so must let them die.&rdquo; (Harris, 257) This, the start of John Harris&rsquo; article, gives a possible future situation that seems to be straightforward, in that most of us would find that the first situation would be a case of a &lsquo;wrongful&rsquo; death, and the second a case of unfortunate circumstances.

                                From the introductory material, we learn that the Great Learning &quot;gives the Confucian educational, moral, and political programs in a nutshell&quot; (1: 84). These ideas are summed up as, and consist of; manifesting the clear character of man, loving the people, and abiding in the highest good. There are also eight steps that should be followed; &quot;the investigation of things, extension of knowledge, sincerity of the will, rectification of the mind, cultivation of the personal life, regulation of the family, national order, and world peace&quot; (1: 84).

                                This semester we have looked at many different philosophers from the pre-Socratic up to Aristotle. For this paper, I will be talking about Aristotle&rsquo;s Nichomachean Ethics and my view of what Aristotle states in this work. Specifically, I will be focusing on his view of happiness and comparing it with my view on happiness. Aristotle first begins Nichomachean Ethics by giving a definition of the good. &ldquo;The good, therefore, has been well defined as that at which all things aim.&rdquo; (Baird, 364) He also states, &ldquo;In cases where the end lies beyond the action the product is naturally superior to the activity&rdquo; (Baird, 364), meaning that the product of an action is more important then the action itself.

                                So far this semester, we have looked at four different writers of the Renaissance period. Of all of them, I personally found Montaigne to be the most interesting and appealing author. For this final paper, I will be discussing Montaigne&rsquo;s use of the self and the main points of the pieces that we read, followed by what I think about Montaigne&rsquo;s writing. The first piece that we read by Montaigne was Essay 14 in Book I: &ldquo;That the taste of good and evil things depends in large part on the opinion we have of them&rdquo;.

                                For my chapter synopsis, I read Chapter XIX. Of the Dissolution of Government for John Locke. This chapter deals with dissolving the government; how governments are dissolved, and what do to when they are. He says that governments are either overturned from without, or from within. When a foreign force conquests the commonwealth, the current government can not survive. Therefore, we return to the state of nature, and are free to survive alone, or find another way to survive, with another government.

                                The following paper was written for an Ancient Philosophy course that I took in college. I have not reviewed it since. Although none of Socrates actual writings exist, what we can get from Plato about Socrates shows the importance that Socrates played in not only the past, but also the influence that he has today. In this paper, I will be discussing the main reasons that Socrates had such an influence on philosophy.

                                This was the first attempt&nbsp;at The Importance of Socrates. Although none of Socrates actual writings exist, what we can get from Plato on Socrates shows the importance that Socrates played not only in the past, but also the influence that he has today. From Plato, we are able to learn some of the reasons that Socrates is important. In this paper, I&rsquo;ll be discussing the main reasons that Socrates was persecuted, in the hopes that this will shed some light on why he was so important.

To sum it up very shortly, free will. Throughout the book, Erasmus is trying to show us that the Bible is filled with examples that strength the idea that an individual has free will, or the choice to do as they want, whether it be good or evil.

It&rsquo;s not hard to see why nationalism doesn&rsquo;t sound like a good idea. Nationalism is the idea that the nation that you live in is important, and that when you look at yourself, you should see your nation, and its ideals. Nationalism has been around for a very long time, probably as long as there have been nations.

                                Sometimes it appeared to him that the great master plan was to hurry his demise. Not always could this be said as true however. Good days were not few, not at all. However, this could also be seen as leading to his demise. After all, the best way to foil someone, is to instill in them a sense of invincibility, rightness. It is when one believes that they cannot fail, that they are more likely to.

                                For this paper, I went to go see The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams. This play was put on at the Weidner Center, and was the first student production that I had seen there. In fact, this was the first time that I had heard of both the story and the author. Overall, I really enjoyed The Glass Menagerie. I thought that the acting was good and I really enjoyed the story.

                                &ldquo;Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains.&rdquo; (Rousseau, Chapter I). Jean-Jacques Rousseau and The Social Contract had a large impact on Western Civilization in the late 18th century. Rousseau based his ideas on some of the writings of previous philosophers, trying to form a good political theory. The Social Contract was developed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau around 1762, during the time of the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment. The Social Contract was based on the ideas of Baron de Montesquieu and John Locke.

                                July 17, 2008: I don&rsquo;t recall writing this, but I guess I did, and I posted it to Epinions.com. Huh. This was a review of The Truce at Bakura (hardcover). The Empire working with the Rebellion? Written: Oct 13 &lsquo;00 Product Rating: 4 of 5 stars Pros: Easy to read and keeps you immersed. Cons: You can get so caught up in the story, that time goes by so quickly! I&rsquo;ve read a lot of books, and Star Wars tends to be my favorite subject.

I have done so and am writing this report to try to describe to you Athenian society. I have many things to tell you about; their culture and politics, the personalities of the Athenians, Athenian &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;, and I want to tell you about Pericles and his &ldquo;Funeral Oration&rdquo;. Upon my arrival, one of the first things I noticed was the size of Athens.

                                In May 1998, at Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon, Kip Kinkel opened fire on his fellow students and his own parents. In April 1999, at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, two students opened fire on teachers and students, and then killed themselves. What caused these students to kill other students? What attracts humans to violence, and what causes some people to push aside their moral values to actually be able to commit such violent acts?

                                Objective In the 1860s, Gregor Mendel followed the pattern of inheritance in plants, hoping to understand the transmission of characteristics by heredity. A few important terms in inheritance are; Segregation: Inherited pairs of genes for traits segregate/separate into separate gametes. Phenotype: In these experiments, the observable trait of a plant. Whether it is tall or short, or green or white. Genotype: The genetic makeup of the plants. Whether it is GG, Gg, or gg, in this experiment.

                                I. Objective For my lab report, I will be discussing the effect of temperature on enzyme activity. Enzymes help a chemical reaction occur faster. The ability of an enzyme to speed up a reaction depends on the environmental conditions. My hypothesis is that if the environment is very cold the enzyme will not be able to function very well. The reason that I say this, is because at cold temperatures, reactions tend to slow down.

                                Introduction Obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD, is defined as having continued thoughts about performing a certain act over and over (McMahon 643). For people living with obsessive-compulsive disorder, it can be very scary to not have control over what you are thinking, and sometimes, even doing. For example, one woman would spend thirteen hours a day washing her hands and her house and if she accidentally touched something else while cleaning, it could set her off and make her spend even more time cleaning (Friedland 70).
