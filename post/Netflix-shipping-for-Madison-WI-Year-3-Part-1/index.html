And so begins year three with Netflix. I covered <a href="http://jamesskemp.github.io/words/words/post/Netflix-shipping-for-Madison-WI.aspx">year one</a> and <a href="http://jamesskemp.github.io/words/words/post/Netflix-shipping-for-Madison-WI-Year-2.aspx">year two</a>, of what was shipped to me, when, and when I shipped them back, previously. 
</p>
<p>
Since last year got a bit long, I&#39;m going to break it up a bit. So, this post covers shipping from September 26, 2008, to about halfway through (I&#39;m not there yet, so ...). 
</p>
<h3>Plan changes</h3>
<p>
On 12/10/2008 I moved from the two-unlimited to the one-unlimited plan. 
</p>
<h3>The times</h3>

<strong>09/27/2008</strong> (Sa) - Received next two movies. Watched Tokyo Story (1953), which was rather long ...<br />
<strong>09/28/2008</strong> (Su) - Watched 3:10 to Yuma (2007), which I had no idea was based on an Elmore Leonard short story ... I&#39;ll drop this and the other off in the mail tomorrow morning.<br />
<strong>09/30/2008</strong> (T) - Movies received by Netflix and next ones shipped.<br />
<strong>10/01/2008</strong> (W) - Received next two movies. Watched The Terminal (2004), which I&#39;ll drop off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>10/02/2008</strong> (R) - Watched Inside Man (2006), which I&#39;ll drop off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>10/03/2008</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Watched Crash (2005), which my mom rented, and&nbsp;which was okay. Near the end reminded me of Magnolia, near the end.<br />
<strong>10/04/2008</strong> (Sa) - Received next movie. Watched Yojimbo (1961), which I&nbsp;picked up a copy of, a while ago.<br />
<strong>10/05/2008</strong> (Su) - Watched The 400 Blows (1959), which I&#39;ll drop off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>10/06/2008</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Watched Videodrome (1983) online.<br />
<strong>10/07/2008</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Received and started watching Ray Bradbury Theater: Vol 1 (1985+). Watched &quot;The Crowd&quot; (which I recognized right&nbsp;away),&nbsp;&quot;Marionettes, Inc.,&quot; &quot;The Playground,&quot; &quot;The Town Where No One Got Off&quot; (very good), &quot;Banshee,&quot; &quot;The Coffin,&quot; and &quot;Gotcha!.&quot;<br />
<strong>10/08/2008</strong> (W) - Watched the rest of Ray Bradbury Theater: Vol 1 (1985+); &quot;The Screaming Woman,&quot; &quot;The Emissary,&quot; &quot;The Man Upstairs,&quot; &quot;The Small Assassin,&quot; &quot;On the Orient, North,&quot; and &quot;The Fruit at the Bottom of the Bowl.&quot; I&#39;ll drop it off today. Received and watched Buffy: The Vampire Slayer (1992). Oddly, I didn&#39;t forget anything about the movie, but actually&nbsp;thought there were more scenes ...&nbsp;I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>10/09/2008</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>10/10/2008</strong> (F) - Watched Burn After Reading (2008), which was actually rather good. Received next movie.<br />
<strong>10/11/2008</strong> (Sa) - Watched Revolver (2006), which I believe is a psychological Jason Statham movie. Huh? I&#39;ll drop it off Sunday or Monday (no mail delivery on Monday), although I might watch it again before I do so ...<br />
<strong>10/13/2008</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Expected delivery on Wednesday.<br />

<strong>10/15/2008</strong> (W) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>10/16/2008</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Received and watched Transylvania 6-5000 (1985), which was actually rather funny, but an abrupt end. Why do they do that to themselves? I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>10/17/2008</strong> (F) - Received next movie.<br />
<strong>10/18/2008</strong> (Sa) - Watched Novocaine: Special Edition (2001), which was very good. I&#39;ll try to drop off today, before lunch. Watched The Big One (1998) online. Watched Big Trouble in Little China (1986) online.<br />
<strong>10/19/2008</strong> (Su) - Watched The Film Crew: Killers from Space (2007). Pretty bad when the most interesting part of the movie takes place in a flashback ... and definitely not MST3K commentary. Watched No Country for Old Men (2007) online. Watched Cashback (2006) online.<br />
<strong>10/20/2008</strong> (M) - Movies received by Netflix and next two shipped.<br />
<strong>10/21/2008</strong> (T) - Received next two movies. Watched Firestarter (1984). I haven&#39;t read the book for over a decade, but I think I liked it better. But, who else could star but Barrymore? I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>10/22/2008</strong> (W) - Watched Running Scared (2006), which was extremely good. I&#39;ll either drop off or let it be picked up tomorrow (I&#39;m on vacation, and I ended up being sick, so I won&#39;t drop it off until Saturday, or Friday night through my sister).<br />
<strong>10/23/2008</strong> (R) - Watched Rob Lumley&#39;s copy of JFK: Director&#39;s Cut (1991). Good, but long. Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Watched 30 Days of Night (2007) online. Watched 2 Days in the Valley (1996) online.<br />
<strong>10/24/2008</strong> (F) - Received and watched The Return of the Living Dead (1985), which is truly a cult film at its best. I&#39;ll mail in the Milwaukee mailer tomorrow (unless my sister takes this and the other and drops them off - I ended up dropping them off late).<br />
<strong>10/25/2008</strong> (Sa) - Watched Heavy Metal (1981) online. Eh.<br />
<strong>10/27/2008</strong> (M) - Movies received by Netflix and next two shipped.<br />
<strong>10/28/2008</strong> (T) - Received next two movies. Watched Hostage (2005), which proves again how great Bruce Willis is. I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>10/30/2008</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Watched Ali (2001), which I&#39;ll drop off tomorrow morning.<br />
<strong>10/31/2008</strong> (F) - Received and watched Better Off Dead (1985). No Joan Cusack? At least there&#39;s a cute French girl ... I&#39;ll drop it off Monday morning. <br />
<strong>11/01/2008</strong> (Sa) - Started November off right, with the feel good flick License to Drive (1988) online.<br />
<strong>11/02/2008</strong> (Su) - Watched Once Upon a Time in China (1991), which had a very good opening/closing song. Netflix is right; definitely a good example of the genre.<br />
<strong>11/03/2008</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>11/04/2008</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Received next movie.<br />
<strong>11/05/2008</strong> (W) - Received and watched The Transporter 2 (2005), which I&#39;ll drop off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>11/06/2008</strong> (R) - Watched L&#39;Avventura (1960), which was good, but long. I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>11/07/2008</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Watched Double Team (1997) online.<br />
<strong>11/09/2008</strong> (Su) - Watched Drunken Master (1978) online.<br />
<strong>11/10/2008</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped, for Wednesday. Received and watched Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002). Okay, but long. I&#39;ll drop off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>11/12/2008</strong> (W) - Received and watched The Last House on the Left: Special Edition (1972), which was fine, and which I&#39;ll drop off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>11/13/2008</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>11/14/2008</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Received and watched the first 6 episodes from Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 1: Vol. 1 (2000). I&#39;ll either drop it off or put it in the mail tomorrow.<br />
<strong>11/15/2008</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched episodes 7 through 10 (id est, the rest) of Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 1: Vol. 2 (2000) and the one-hour special feature. I&#39;ll drop off Sunday or Monday morning. Overall, good, but painful; how many episodes can you get yourself into a hole?<br />
<strong>11/16/2008</strong> (Su) - Watched Legend: The Director&#39;s Cut (1986) online.<br />
<strong>11/17/2008</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Watched my copy of Appleseed Ex Machina (2007).<br />
<strong>11/18/2008</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Received and watched Starship Troopers (1997), which wasn&#39;t half bad. I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>11/19/2008</strong> (W) - Received and watched Flight of the Conchords: Season 1: Disc 1 (2007), which I&#39;ll drop off tomorrow. Funny moments, but they&#39;re spread out a bit ...<br />
<strong>11/20/2008</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>11/21/2008</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Received and watched The Last King of Scotland (2006). Great performances. I&#39;ll try to put it in the mail tomorrow, otherwise Monday morning. (It was picked up Saturday.)<br />
<strong>11/22/2008</strong> (Sa) - Received and watched Flight of the Conchords: Season 1: Disc 2 (2007), which I&#39;ll drop off Sunday or Monday morning (probably the latter). I just wish I got half the music references ...<br />
<strong>11/24/2008</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix. Watched Natural Born Killers (1994) online, which I hadn&#39;t watched in quite some time. Still don&#39;t really care for it. Natural born, but here&#39;s the environment that made them the way that they are. Umm ...<br />
<strong>11/25/2008</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and two new ones shipped, one from NM.<br />
<strong>11/26/2008</strong> (W) - Received next movie, but it was damaged. Reported it as such, but I won&#39;t get the replacement until Monday. Grief.<br />
<strong>11/27/2008</strong> (R) - Watched my copies of Jurassic Park (1993), The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), and Alien (1979).<br />
<strong>11/28/2008</strong> (F) - Received and watched Kingdom Hospital: Disc 1 (2004), which had episodes 1 to 3. Very good. I&#39;ll let it be picked up tomorrow and guess I will use the New Mexico (PO Box 27823, Albuquerque, NM 87125-9740) mailer, since they won&#39;t get it until Monday, at the earliest,&nbsp;anyways.<br />
<strong>11/30/2008</strong> (Su) - Watched Tank Girl (1995) online.<br />
<strong>12/01/2008</strong> (M) - Both movies received by Netflix and next two shipped.<br />
<strong>12/02/2008</strong> (T)&nbsp;- Received two new movies, but didn&#39;t have time for either.<br />
<strong>12/03/2008</strong> (W) - Watched Mission Impossible (1996) which wasn&#39;t too bad, even if I did know basically what was going to happen (even though I haven&#39;t watched it before). I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow morning.<br />
<strong>12/05/2008</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Still haven&#39;t had time for the other dvd.<br />
<strong>12/06/2008</strong> (Sa)&nbsp;- Received next movie.<br />
<strong>12/07/2008</strong> (Su) - Watched Kingdom Hospital: Disc 2 (2004), which had episodes 4-7. Still, very good. Watched London, which was extremely different than I thought (but still good), due to Jason Statham having a full head of hair. I&#39;ll put both of these in one mailer and mail them tomorrow. Hopefully they&#39;ll ship out two dvds to replace, but ... we&#39;ll see.<br />
<strong>12/09/2008</strong> (T)&nbsp;- Both movies received by Netflix and, surprisingly, next two shipped.<br />
<strong>12/10/2008</strong> (W) - Received next two movies. Watched Footloose (1984), which I&#39;ll drop off tomorrow. The Milwaukee mailer was destoryed, so sending off to Madison.<br />
<strong>12/11/2008</strong> (R) - Watched Kingdom Hospital: The Complete Series: Disc 3 (2004), which contained episodes 8-11. Weirder this time around ... I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>12/12/2008</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix.<br />
<strong>12/13/2008</strong> (Sa) - Watched Strange Brew (1983) online, on my Xbox 360.<br />
<strong>12/14/2008</strong> (Su) - Watched Hudson Hawk (1991) online, on my Xbox 360.<br />
<strong>12/15/2008</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Watched Groundhog Day (1993) online, on my Xbox 360.<br />
<strong>12/16/2008</strong> (T) - Received and watched Wasabi (2001). Great movie, although the ending was a bit too quick; they should have just let it run for 30 more minutes. I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>12/18/2008</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>12/19/2008</strong> (F) - Received and watched Kingdom Hospital: The Complete Series: Disc 4 (and all the special features). I&#39;ll either let it be picked up tomorrow, drop it off tomorrow, or drop it off for Monday (it was Saturday). <br />
<strong>12/20/2008</strong> (Sa) - Watched Sukiyaki Western Django (2007) online, on my Xbox 360. That&#39;s four versions of Yojimbo&#39;s story&nbsp;that I&#39;ve seen now.<br />
<strong>12/22/2008</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>12/23/2008</strong> (T) - Received and watched Casino Royale (2006). Wow. I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow. Might try to watch the next in theatres (still at one, with limited show times).<br />
<strong>12/25/2008</strong> (R) - Watched Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) and Cleopatra Jones (1973) online, on my Xbox 360.<br />
<strong>12/26/2008</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Survey emailed on how Cleopatra Jones&#39; quality was; interesting. Watched The Core (2003) online on my Xbox.<br />
<strong>12/27/2008</strong> (Sa) - Watched the double-feature The Oblong Box and Scream and Scream Again (1969) on my Xbox. Received next movie.<br />
<strong>12/28/2008</strong> (Su) - Watched High Plains Drifter (1973) on my Xbox. Watched West Side Story (1961), which I&#39;ll drop off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>12/30/2008</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>12/31/2008</strong> (W) - Watched Pale Rider (1985) on my Xbox. Not his best, but good nonetheless. Received next movie. Watched Boiling Point (1993) on my Xbox.<br />
<strong>01/01/2009</strong> (R) - Watched Tropic Thunder (2008), which should be picked up today (otherwise I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow). (Dropped off Friday as there was no mail pick-up Thursday.)<br />
<strong>01/02/2009</strong> (F) - Watched Eraser (1996) on my Xbox.<br />
<strong>01/05/2009</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>01/06/2009</strong> (T) - For some reason, they&#39;re shipping another movie (that I won&#39;t get until Friday), but I still have to send both back to get another. WTF? Received and watched Dead Space: Downfall (2008). Eh. Not bad, but not all that great, mainly due to the animation; looks like Fox Saturday morning cartoons. I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow (but not in the Milwaukee mailer). Watched the semi-philosophical The Man From Earth (2007) on my Xbox, but I&#39;m not quite sure what to think of it, entirely ... Very interesting idea though; I&#39;ll have to look into Jerome Bixby&#39;s works ...<br />
<strong>01/07/2009</strong> (W) - Watched Happenstance (2000) on my Xbox. Slow, but how things weave together is interesting.<br />
<strong>01/08/2009</strong> (R) - Contrary to what they said, movie recieved by Netflix and next one shipped. Watched Paris, Je T&#39;aime (2006) on my Xbox. Shouldn&#39;t watch two French films in a row again. 4 1/2 stars, but I&#39;ll give it 5 because it&#39;s so odd ...<br />
<strong>01/09/2009</strong> (F) - Received and watched The Grateful Dead Movie (1977) and Unleashed: Lords of Dogtown (2005). The former wasn&#39;t as good as The Band doc I watched a while back (empty promises), and the latter was pretty darn good. I&#39;ll mail off to PO Box 49021, Sane Jose, CA 95161-9959 tomorrow.<br />
<strong>01/12/2009</strong> (M) - Movies received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>01/13/2009</strong> (T) - Received and watched Dead Alive (1992). Certainly was a blood-drenched zombie buffet at the end. I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>01/15/2009</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>01/16/2009</strong> (F) - Received next movie.<br />

<strong>01/19/2009</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>01/20/2009</strong> (T) - Received and watched Red Beard (1965). Long, but very good storytelling, as usual from Kurosawa. I&#39;ll drop off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>01/22/2009</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>01/23/2009</strong> (F) - Received and watched The Naked City (1948). The first commentary was very good (I feel asleep afterwards ...), talking about this being the first noir, and the importance of cogs. I&#39;ll let it be picked up tomorrow, using the mailer to PO Box 079, Milwaukee WI 53201-9683, which I received it in.<br />
<strong>01/25/2009</strong> (Su) - Watched Prince of Darkness (1987) on my Xbox 360. Rather good.<br />
<strong>01/26/2009</strong> (M) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>01/27/2009</strong> (T) - Received and watched Django (1966), an okay copy of the true Sergio. I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow. (I actually let it be picked up.)<br />
<strong>01/29/2009</strong> (R) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>01/30/2009</strong> (F) - Received next movie, but I&#39;m gone this weekend ...<br />
<strong>02/01/2009</strong> (Su) - Watched El Mariachi/Desperado (1995) double-pack, which I&#39;ll drop off tomorrow, using the mailer I received it in (PO Box 3079, Milwaukee WI 53201-9683).<br />
<strong>02/03/2009</strong> (T) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped. Watched Angel-A (2007) online. Luc Besson could be a god. Crying and smiling.<br />
<strong>02/04/2009</strong> (W) - Received and watched The Big Lebowski (1998), which I&#39;ll drop off tomorrow, using a spare Madison mailer (instead of Milwaukee).<br />

<strong>02/18/2009</strong> (W) - Received and watched Get Carter (1971), which certainly seems quite different than what I recall the later version being. I&#39;ll drop it off tomorrow.<br />
<strong>02/20/2009</strong> (F) - Movie received by Netflix and next one shipped.<br />
<strong>02/21/2009</strong> (Sa) - Received next movie.<br />
